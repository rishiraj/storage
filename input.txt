ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup 2022
Playing Conditions

i

Preamble – The Spirit of Cricket
Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws
(which are incorporated within these Playing Conditions), but also within the Spirit of Cricket.
The major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and,
especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents.
Respect is central to the Spirit of Cricket.
Respect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires.
Play hard and play fair.
Accept the umpire’s decision.
Create a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise.
Show self-discipline, even when things go against you.
Congratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team.
Thank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result.
Cricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together people from
different nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket.

1 THE PLAYERS
1.1

Number of players

A match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain.
1.1.1

In exceptional circumstances a team may participate in a match with less than eleven players. However, in
such circumstances there must be a minimum of nine players in each team that are eligible to participate for
the team who are official playing squad members. In addition, in circumstances where there are less than
eleven eligible players available to play in a team, a member of the relevant team’s management will be
permitted to act as a substitute fielder(s), such substitutes must be drawn from the official squad.

1.1.2

If a team has fewer than nine fit and eligible players or does not wish to play with fewer than eleven fit and
eligible players, a match will be abandoned, subject to the rescheduling considerations outlined below.

1.1.3

The Biosafety Advisory Group (BSAG) will be the final arbiter as to the COVID status of any player and his
consequential availability to participate in a match.

1.1.4

If a team has traveling reserves within the official squad and they are fit to play, they must be made available
if this would enable a team to field 11 players.

1.1.5

If a team refuses to participate in a match that has been confirmed as proceeding by the BSAG and Event
Technical Committee, this will be considered a forfeit in accordance with the Playing Conditions.

1.2
1.2.1

Nomination and replacement of players
Each captain shall nominate 11 players plus a maximum of 4 substitute fielders in writing on the team sheet
provided by the ICC. Other than set out in clause 1.2.7, no player (member of the playing eleven) may be
changed after the nomination and prior to the start of play without the consent of the opposing captain.
Immediately prior to the toss, the ICC Match Referee or their nominee shall check with both team captains
that the players nominated on the team sheets are correct.

1.2.2

Only those nominated as substitute fielders (see also clause 1.2.2 above) shall be entitled to act as
substitute fielders during the match, unless the ICC Match Referee, in exceptional circumstances, allows
subsequent additions.

1

1.2.3

All those nominated including those nominated as substitute fielders, as well as any Concussion
Replacements, must be official squad members of that particular team and by such nomination the
nominees shall warrant that they are so eligible.

1.2.4

In addition, by their nomination, the nominees shall be deemed to have agreed to abide by all the applicable
ICC Regulations pertaining to international cricket and in particular, the Clothing and Equipment
Regulations, the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel (hereafter referred to as the
ICC Code of Conduct), the Anti-Discrimination Code for Players and Player Support Personnel, the AntiDoping Code and the Anti-Corruption Code.

1.2.5

A player or player support personnel who has been suspended from participating in a match shall not, from
the toss of the coin and for the remainder of the match thereafter:

1.2.5.1

Be nominated as, or carry out any of the duties or responsibilities of a substitute fielder, or

1.2.5.2

Enter any part of the playing area (which shall include the field of play and the area between the boundary
and the perimeter boards) at any time, including any scheduled or unscheduled breaks in play.

1.2.6

A player who has been suspended from participating in a match shall be permitted from the toss of the coin
and for the remainder of the match thereafter be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room provided that
the players’ dressing room (or any part thereof) for the match is not within the playing area described in
clause 1.2.5.2 above (for example, the player is not permitted to enter the on-field ‘dug-out’).

1.2.7

Concussion Replacement

1.2.7.1 If a player sustains a concussion or suspected concussion as a result of a head or neck injury during the
course of the relevant match, a Concussion Replacement may be permitted in the following circumstances:
1.2.7.1.1 the head or neck injury must have been sustained during play and within the playing area
described in clause 1.2.5.2 above;
1.2.7.1.2 a concussion or suspected concussion must have been formally diagnosed by the Team Medical
Representative;
1.2.7.1.3 the Team Medical Representative or Team Manager shall submit a Concussion Replacement
Request to the ICC Match Referee on a standard form, which shall:
1.2.7.1.3.1 identify the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected concussion;
1.2.7.1.3.2 specify the incident in which the concussion or suspected concussion was sustained,
including the time at which it occurred;
1.2.7.1.3.3 confirm that, following an examination, the Team Medical Representative believes or
suspects that the player has sustained a concussion as a result of the incident specified in
clause 1.2.7.1.3.2 above; and
1.2.7.1.3.4 identify the requested Concussion Replacement, who shall be a like-for-like replacement
for the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected concussion.
1.2.7.2 The Concussion Replacement Request must be submitted as soon as possible after the incident specified in
clause 1.2.7.1.3.2 if a Concussion Replacement is to be permitted.
1.2.7.3 The ICC Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the replacement is
a like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his/her team for the remainder of the
match.
1.2.7.4 In assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player,
the ICC Match Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during the
remainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion
Replacement.
1.2.7.5 If the ICC Match Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Concussion Replacement, when
performing their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the ICC Match Referee may impose

2

such conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Concussion Replacement as he/she sees fit, in line
with the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the concussed player.
1.2.7.6 The ICC Match Referee may, in reviewing a Concussion Replacement Request made in accordance with
clause 1.2.7.1.3, request any such further information as may be required in order to make the determination
required under clauses 1.2.7.4 and 1.2.7.5.
1.2.7.7 The decision of the ICC Match Referee in relation to any Concussion Replacement Request shall be final
and neither team shall have any right of appeal.
1.2.7.8 Once the Concussion Replacement has been approved by the ICC Match Referee, the replaced player shall
play no further part in the match.
1.2.7.9 Both the Concussion Replacement and the replaced player shall be considered to have played in the match
for records and statistical purposes.

1.3

Captain

1.3.1

If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for him.

1.3.2

If a captain is not available to nominate the players, then any person associated with that team may act as
his/her deputy to do so. See clause 1.2.

1.3.3

At any time after the nomination of the players, only a nominated player can act as deputy in discharging the
duties and responsibilities of the captain as stated in these Playing Conditions, including at the toss. See
clause 13.4 (The toss).

1.4

3

2.3

Consultation with Ground Authority

Before the match the umpires shall consult with the Ground Authority to determine;
2.3.1

which clock or watch and back-up time piece is to be used during the match.

2.3.2

the boundary of the field of play. See clause 19 (Boundaries).

2.3.3

the use of covers. See clause 10 (Covering the pitch).

2.3.4

any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match.

inform the scorers of agreements in 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.4.

2.4

The wickets, creases and boundaries

Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that
2.4.1

the creases are correctly marked. See clause 7 (The creases).

2.4.2

the wickets are properly pitched. See clause 8 (The wickets).

2.4.3

the boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of clauses 19.1 (Determining the boundary
of the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary).

the implements used in the match conform to the following

2.5.2.1

clause 4 (The ball).

2.5.4

the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of clause 27.2 (Gloves).

2.6

Fair and unfair play

The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play.

2.7
2.7.1

Fitness for play
It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or
exceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place.
Conditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal.
The fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as
unreasonable or dangerous.

2.7.2

Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player
or umpire.

2.7.3

Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible
for play to proceed.

2.7.4

If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold,
the fielders of the power of free movement, or the batter of the ability to play their strokes or to run between

4

the wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable
for play to take place.

2.8

Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances

2.8.1

All references to ground include the pitch. See clause 6.1 (Area of pitch).

2.8.2

If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other
circumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to
start or to recommence. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one
for the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee.

2.8.3

If circumstances are warranted, the umpires shall stop play and instruct the Ground Authority to take
whatever action they can and use whatever equipment is necessary to remove as much dew as possible
from the outfield when conditions become unreasonable or dangerous. The umpires may also instruct the
ground staff to take such action during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play.

2.8.4

The umpires shall disregard any shadow on the pitch from the stadium or from any permanent object on the
ground.

2.8.5

Light Meters
It is the responsibility of the ICC to supply light meters to the match officials to be used in accordance with
these playing conditions.

2.8.5.1

All light meters shall be uniformly calibrated.

2.8.5.2

The umpires shall be entitled to use light meter readings as a guideline for determining whether the light is
fit for play in accordance with the criteria set out in clause 2.8.2 above.

2.8.5.3

Light meter readings may accordingly be used by the umpires:

2.8.5.3.1

To determine whether there has been at any stage a deterioration or improvement in the light.

2.8.5.3.2

As benchmarks for the remainder of a match.

2.8.6

Use of artificial lights
If in the opinion of the umpires, natural light is deteriorating to an unfit level, they shall authorise the Ground
Authority to use the available artificial lighting so that the match can commence or continue in acceptable
conditions.
In the event of power failure or lights malfunction, the provisions relating to the delay or interruption of play
due to bad weather or light shall apply.

2.8.7

When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions. They shall
make inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials. Immediately the
umpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the
players to resume play.

2.8.8

The safety of all persons within the ground is of paramount importance to the ICC. In the event that of any
threatening circumstance, whether actual or perceived (including for example weather, pitch invasions, act
of God, etc.), then the umpires, on the advice of the ICC Match Referee, should suspend play and all
players and officials should immediately be asked to leave the field of play in a safe and orderly manner and
to relocate to a secure and safe area (depending on each particular threat) pending the satisfactory passing
or resolution of such threat or risk to the reasonable satisfaction of the umpires, ICC Match Referee, the
head of the relevant Ground Authority, the head of ground security and/or the police as the circumstances
may require.

2.8.9

Where play is suspended under clause 2.8.8 above the decision to abandon or resume play shall be the
responsibility of the ICC Match Referee who shall act only after consultation with the head of ground security
and the police.

5

2.9

Position of umpires

The umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required.
Subject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with
either the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view.
The striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he/she informs
the captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire.

2.10 Umpires changing ends

short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded.

2.13.2

The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before
allowing play to proceed.
If several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred.

2.14 Informing the umpires
Wherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players under these Playing Conditions, it will
be sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire.

2.15 Correctness of scores
Consultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. The umpires shall, throughout the match,
satisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where
appropriate, the number of overs bowled.
The umpires shall ensure that they are able to contact the scorers at any time during the match and at its conclusion
to address any issues relating to the correctness of scores.

6.1

Area of pitch

The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in width. It is bounded at
either end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining
the centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. If the pitch is next to an artificial pitch

9

which is closer than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the junction of the
two surfaces. See clauses 8.1 (Description, width and pitching), 7.2 (The bowling crease), and Appendix C.

6.2

Fitness of pitch for play

The umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. See clauses 2.7 (Fitness for play) and 2.8
(Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions).

6.3

Selection and preparation

Before the match, the Ground Authority shall be responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch. During the
match, the umpires shall control its use and maintenance.
6.3.1

The Ground Authority shall ensure that during the period prior to the start of play and during intervals, the
pitch area shall be roped off so as to prevent unauthorised access. (The pitch area shall include an area at
least 2 metres beyond the rectangle made by the crease markings at both ends of the pitch).

6.3.2

The fourth umpire shall ensure that, prior to the start of play and during any intervals, only authorised staff,
the ICC match officials, players, team coaches and authorised television personnel shall be allowed access
to the pitch area. Such access shall be subject to the following limitations:

6.3.2.1

Only captains and team coaches may walk on the actual playing surface of the pitch area (outside of the
crease markings).

6.3.2.2

Access to the pitch area by television personnel shall be restricted to one camera crew (including one or
two television commentators) of the official licensed television broadcaster(s) (but not news crews).

6.3.2.3

No spiked footwear shall be permitted.

6.3.2.4

No one shall be permitted to bounce a ball on the pitch, strike it with a bat or cause damage to the pitch in
any other way.

6.3.2.5

Access shall not interfere with pitch preparation.

6.3.3

6.4

In the event of any dispute, the ICC Match Referee will rule and his/her ruling will be final.

Changing the pitch

6.4.1

If the on-field umpires decide that it is dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on the match pitch,
they shall stop play and immediately advise the ICC Match Referee.

6.4.2

The on-field umpires and the ICC Match Referee shall then consult with both captains.

6.4.3

If the captains agree to continue, play shall resume.

6.4.4

If the decision is not to resume play, the on-field umpires together with the ICC Match Referee shall consider
whether the existing pitch can be repaired and the match resumed from the point it was stopped. In
considering whether to authorise such repairs, the ICC Match Referee must consider whether this would
place either side at an unfair advantage, given the play that had already taken place on the dangerous pitch.

6.4.5

If the decision is that the existing pitch cannot be repaired, then the match is to be abandoned with the
following consequences:

6.4.5.1

In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match having been completed at the time the
match is abandoned, the result shall be determined according to the provisions of clause 16.4.2.

6.4.5.2

In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match not having been completed, the match
will be abandoned as a no result.

6.4.6

If the abandonment occurs on the day of the match, the ICC Match Referee shall consult with the Event
Technical Committee with the objective of finding a way for a new match (including a new nomination of
teams and toss) to commence on the same date and venue. Such a match may be played either on the
repaired pitch or on another pitch, subject to the ICC Match Referee and the relevant Ground Authority both
being satisfied that the new pitch will be of the required T20I standard. The playing time lost between the

13

9.7

Securing of footholds and maintenance of pitch

scheduled or re-scheduled cessation time for the first innings, the umpires shall reduce the length of the
interval by the amount of time that the first innings over-ran. The minimum time for the interval will be 10
minutes.

11.4.2

However, following a lengthy delay or interruption prior to the completion of the innings of the team batting
first, the Match Referee may, at his/her discretion, reduce the interval between innings from 20 minutes to
not less than 10 minutes.

11.4.3

Such discretion should only be exercised after determining the adjusted overs per side based on a 20
minute interval. If having exercised this discretion, the rescheduled finishing time for the match is earlier than
the latest possible finishing time, then these minutes should be deducted from the length of any interruption
during the second innings before determining the overs remaining.

shall receive its full quota of 20 overs irrespective of the number of overs it bowled in the scheduled time
for the cessation of the first innings.

13.7.1.3

If the team batting first is dismissed in less than 20 overs, the team batting second shall be entitled to bat
for 20 overs.

Delay or Interruption to the Innings of the Team Batting First (see paragraph 1 of Appendix E)

13.7.2.1.1

When playing time has been lost the revised number of overs to be bowled in the match shall be based
on a rate of 14.11 overs per hour in the total remaining time available for play.

13.7.2.1.2

The revision of the number of overs should ensure, whenever possible, that both teams have the
opportunity of batting for the same number of overs. The team batting second shall not bat for a
greater number of overs than the first team unless the latter completed its innings in less than its
allocated overs. To constitute a match, a minimum of 5 overs have to be bowled to the side batting
second, subject to a result not being achieved earlier. For the semi-finals and final, a minimum of 10
over have to be bowled to the side batting second, subject to a result not being achieved earlier.

13.7.2.1.4

A fixed time will be specified for the commencement of the interval, and also the close of play for the
match, by applying a rate of 14.11 overs per hour. When calculating the length of playing time available
for the match, or the length of either innings, the timing and duration of all relative delays, extensions in

20

playing hours, interruptions in play, and intervals will be taken into consideration. This calculation must
not cause the match to finish earlier than the original or rescheduled time for cessation of play on the
final scheduled day for play. If required the original time shall be extended to allow for one extra over
for each team.
13.7.2.1.5

If the team fielding first fails to bowl the revised number of overs by the specified time, play shall
continue until the required number of overs have been bowled or the innings is completed.

13.7.2.1.6

Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to clause 13.8 and the ICC Code of Conduct).

13.7.2.2

the opportunity of receiving its allocated, or revised allocation of overs in the playing time available, the
number of overs shall be reduced at a rate of 14.11 overs per hour in respect of the lost playing time.
Should the calculations result in a fraction of an over the fraction shall be ignored.

13.7.2.2.2

In addition, should the innings of the team batting first have been completed prior to the scheduled, or
re-scheduled time for the commencement of the interval, then any calculation relating to the revision of
overs shall not be effective until an amount of time equivalent to that by which the second innings
started early has elapsed.

13.7.2.2.3

To constitute a match, a minimum of 5 overs have to be bowled to the team batting second subject to a
result not being achieved earlier. For the semi-finals and final, a minimum of 10 overs have to be
bowled to the side batting second, subject to a result not being achieved earlier.

13.7.2.2.4

The team batting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first team unless the latter
completed its innings in less than its allocated overs.

13.7.2.2.5

A fixed time will be specified for the close of play by applying a rate of 14.11 overs per hour. The timing
and duration of all relative delays, extensions in playing hours and interruptions in play will be taken
into consideration in specifying this time.

13.7.2.2.6

If the team fielding second fails to bowl the revised overs by the scheduled or re-scheduled close of
play, the hours of play shall be extended until the overs have been bowled or a result achieved.

13.7.2.2.7

Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to clause 13.8 and the ICC Code of Conduct).

13.7.3

Extra Time

13.7.3.1

30-minute break between matches.

13.7.3.3

For clarity, the changeover period (5 minutes) for a Super Over after the main match is not to be taken into
account when applying any permitted extra time available.

13.8

Over-Rate Penalties

13.8.1

The fielding side shall be in position to bowl the first ball of the final over of the innings by the scheduled (or
re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings (calculated in accordance with clause 13.7). In delayed or
interrupted matches where there has been a reduction of 3 or more overs pursuant to clause 13.7.2, the
fielding side shall be in position to bowl the first ball of the penultimate over of the innings by the scheduled
(or re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings.

13.8.3.2 a side’s innings is completed prior to the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time for the
innings.

13.8.4

The bowler’s end umpire shall inform the captain of the fielding side, the batter and the other umpire of:
13.8.4.1 the scheduled cessation time for the innings prior to the start of the innings, and of any rescheduled cessation time following any subsequent interruption to play; and
13.8.4.2 any time allowances pursuant to clause 12.8.3 as and when they arise.

14 THE FOLLOW-ON
Shall not apply.

15 DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE
Shall not apply.

16 THE RESULT
16.1 A Win
16.1.1

Unless the winner is determined by DLS (see clause 16.4) the side which has scored in its one innings a
total of runs in excess of that scored by the opposing side in its one completed innings shall win the match.
See clause 13.3 (Completed innings). Note also clause 16.4 (Winning hit or extras).

16.1.2

Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s
refusal to play (clause 16.2), a result can be achieved only if both teams have had the opportunity of batting
for at least 5 overs, unless one team has been all out in less than 5 overs or unless the team batting second
scores enough runs to win in less than 5 overs (10 overs in the semi-finals and final).

22

16.1.3

Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s
refusal to play (clause 16.2), all matches in which both teams have not had an opportunity of batting for a
minimum of 5 overs (10 overs in the semi-finals and final), shall be declared a No Result.

16.2 ICC Match Referee awarding a match
16.2.1

A match shall be lost by a side which either

16.2.1.1

concedes defeat or

16.2.1.2

in the opinion of the ICC Match Referee refuses to play and the ICC Match Referee shall award the match
to the other side.

16.2.2

If an umpire considers that an action by any player or players might constitute a refusal by either side to play
then the umpires together shall inform the ICC Match Referee of this fact. The ICC Match Referee shall
together with the umpires ascertain the cause of the action. If the ICC Match Referee, after due consultation
with the umpires, then decides that this action does constitute a refusal to play by one side, he/she shall so
inform the captain of that side. If the captain persists in the action the ICC Match Referee shall award the
match in accordance with clause 16.2.1.2 above.

16.2.3

If action as in clause 16.2.2 above takes place after play has started and does not constitute a refusal to
play the delay or interruption in play shall be dealt with in the same manner as provided for in clauses 13.7.2
(Delayed and Interrupted Matches) and 11.4 (Changing agreed times for intervals) above.
Note: In addition to the consequences of any refusal to play prescribed under this clause, any such
refusal, whether temporary or final, may result in disciplinary action being taken against the captain and
team responsible under the ICC Code of Conduct.

16.3 All other matches – A Tie or No Result
16.3.1

A Tie

16.3.1.1 The result of a match shall be a tie when both innings have been completed and the scores are equal.
16.3.1.2 If the match is tied a Super Over is played. If the Super Over is a tie, then subsequent Super Overs shall be
played until there is a winner. Unless exceptional circumstances arise, there shall be an unlimited number of
Super Overs played to achieve a result. Refer to Appendix F.
16.3.2

No Result
See clause 16.1.3 above.

16.4 Calculation of the Target Score
16.4.1
16.4.1.1

16.4.2
16.4.2.1

Interrupted Matches
If, due to suspension of play after the start of the match, the number of overs in the innings of either team
has to be revised to a lesser number than originally allotted (minimum of 5 overs), then a revised target
score (to win) should be set for the number of overs which the team batting second will have the
opportunity of facing. This revised target is to be calculated using DLS. The target set will always be a
whole number and one run less will constitute a Tie.
Prematurely Terminated Matches
If the innings of the side batting second is suspended (with at least 5 overs bowled) and it is not possible
for the match to be resumed, the match will be decided by comparison with the DLS ‘Par Score’
determined at the instant of the suspension using DLS. If the score is equal to the par score, the match is
a Tie. Otherwise the result is a victory, or defeat, by the margin of runs by which the score exceeds, or falls
short of, the Par Score.

23

16.5 Winning hit or extras
16.5.1

As soon as a result is reached as defined in clauses 16.1, 16.2 or 16.3.1, the match is at an end. Nothing
that happens thereafter, except as in clause 41.17.2 (Penalty runs), shall be regarded as part of it. Note also
clause 16.8.

16.5.2

The side batting last will have scored enough runs to win only if its total of runs is sufficient without including
any runs completed by the batters before the completion of a catch, or the obstruction of a catch, from which
the striker could be dismissed.

16.5.3

If a boundary is scored before the batters have completed sufficient runs to win the match, the whole of the
boundary allowance shall be credited to the side’s total and, in the case of a hit by the bat, to the striker’s
score.

16.6 Statement of result
If the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of
wickets still then to fall, unless clause 16.4.2.1 (Prematurely Terminated Matches) applies.
If, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the innings of the side
batting last has been completed, but as the result of an award of 5 Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to
win, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by Penalty runs.
If the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs.
If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as Match
Conceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be.

16.7 Correctness of result
Any decision as to the correctness of the scores shall be the responsibility of the umpires. See clause 2.15
(Correctness of scores).

16.8 Mistakes in scoring
If, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been concluded, the umpires
discover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the result then, subject to clause 16.9, they shall adopt
the following procedure.
16.8.1

If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its innings and,
either the number of overs to be bowled in that innings has not been completed, or
the end of the innings has not been reached
then, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume.
Unless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until the prescribed number of
overs has been completed. The number of overs shall be taken as they were at the call of Time for the
supposed conclusion of the match. No account shall be taken of the time between that moment and the
resumption of play.

16.8.2

If, at this call of Time, the overs have been completed and no Playing time remains, or if the side batting last
has completed its innings, the umpires shall immediately inform both captains of the necessary corrections
to the scores and to the result.

16.9 Result not to be changed
Once the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the conclusion of the match – see
clauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed.

the competition will be decided in the following order of priority:
a) The team with the greatest number of wins in its Group will be placed in the higher position.
b) If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the Group stage, then in such case the

team with the higher net run rate in the Group stage will be placed in the higher position (refer to
clause 16.10.9 below for the calculation of net run rate).
c) If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the head to head match played

between them (points then net run rate in those matches)
d) If the above does not resolve the Group ordering, or if all matches within a Group produce no results,

then the teams will be ordered as per their original First Round Group seedings.
16.10.6

Super 12s

In the event of teams finishing on equal points in their Group, the right to progress to the semi-finals will be
decided in the following order of priority:
a) The team with the greatest number of wins in its Group will be placed in the higher position.
b) If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in its Group, then in such case the team with

the higher net run rate in its Group will be placed in the higher position (refer to clause 16.10.9
below for the calculation of net run rate).
c) If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the head-to-head match played

between them (points then net run rate in those matches).

26

to the Final. Refer attached Appendix F.
b) If following a tie, weather conditions prevent the Super Over from being completed, or if the

a) In the event of a tied final, the teams shall compete in a Super Over to determine which team is the
winner. Refer attached Appendix F.
b) If following a tie, weather conditions prevent the Super Over from being completed, or if the
match is abandoned or a no result, the teams shall be declared joint winners.
16.10.9

Net Run Rate

A team’s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team
throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.
In the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall
be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in
which the team was dismissed.
Note: The Super Over is not included in the net run rate calculation.
Only those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where
a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis/Stern, for net run rate purposes
Team 1 will be credited with Team 2’s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by
Team 2. Where a match is concluded with Duckworth/Lewis/Stern having been applied at an earlier point in
the match, Team 1 will be credited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number
of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.
In circumstances where a match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team’s
refusal to play, either by the match referee in accordance with playing condition 16.2 or in accordance with the
provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the defaulting team
shall be affected in that the full 20 overs of the defaulting team’s innings in such forfeited match shall be taken into
account in calculating the average runs per over of the defaulting team over the course of the relevant portion of the
competition. For the avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such forfeited match will not be taken
into account when calculating the net run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.

17 THE OVER
17.1 Number of balls
The ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 valid balls.

17.2 Start of an over
An over has started when the bowler starts his/her run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his/her action for the first
delivery of that over.

17.3 Validity of balls
17.3.1

A ball shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over unless it is delivered, even though, as in clause 38.3
(Non-striker leaving his/her ground early) a batter may be dismissed or some other incident occurs without
the ball having been delivered.

17.3.2

A ball delivered by the bowler shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over

27

17.3.2.1

if it is called dead, or is to be considered dead, before the striker has had an opportunity to play it. See
clause 20.6 (Dead ball; ball counting as one of over).

17.3.2.2

if it is called dead in the circumstances of clause 20.4.2.6. Note also the special provisions of clause

balls shall count towards the 6 balls of the over.

17.4 Call of Over
When 6 valid balls have been bowled and when the ball becomes dead, the umpire shall call Over before leaving the
wicket. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time).

17.5 Umpire miscounting
17.5.1

If the umpire miscounts the number of valid balls, the over as counted by the umpire shall stand.

17.5.2

If, having miscounted, the umpire allows an over to continue after 6 valid balls have been bowled, he/she
may subsequently call Over when the ball becomes dead after any delivery, even if that delivery is not a
valid ball.

17.5.3

Whenever possible, the third umpire shall liaise with the scorers and if possible inform the on-field umpires if
the over has been miscounted.

17.6 Bowler changing ends
A bowler shall be allowed to change ends as often as desired, provided he/she does not bowl two overs

interruption, it shall be completed on resumption of play.

17.8 Bowler incapacitated or suspended during an over
If for any reason a bowler is incapacitated while running up to deliver the first ball of an over, or is incapacitated
during an over, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. If a bowler is incapacitated or suspended during an over,
another bowler shall complete the over from the same end, provided that he/she does not bowl two overs
consecutively, nor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in that innings.

18 SCORING RUNS
18.1 A run

When runs are disallowed, the one run penalty for No ball or Wide shall stand and 5 run penalties shall be allowed,
except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side).

18.3 Short runs
18.3.1

A run is short if a batter fails to make good his/her ground in turning for a further run.

18.3.2

Although a short run shortens the succeeding one, the latter if completed shall not be regarded as short. A
striker setting off for the first run from in front of the popping crease may do so also without penalty.

18.4 Unintentional short runs
Except in the circumstances of clause 18.5,
18.4.1

if either batter runs a short run, the umpire concerned shall, unless a boundary is scored, call and signal
Short run as soon as the ball becomes dead and that run shall not be scored. In accordance with paragraph
2.5 of Appendix D, the third umpire shall review any call of Short run and communicate his/her decision to
the relevant on-field umpire.

18.4.2

if either batter run short, a boundary is scored the umpire concerned shall disregard the short running and
shall not call or signal Short run unless the boundary is a result of an overthrow or wilful act of the fielder
(see clause 19.8 Overthrow or wilful act of fielder).

18.4.3

if both batters run short in one and the same run, this shall be regarded as only one short run.

18.4.4

scored.

18.4.5

recorded.

18.5 Deliberate short runs
18.5.1

If either umpire considers that one or both batters deliberately ran short at that umpire’s end, the umpire
concerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has
occurred and apply clause 18.5.2.

18.5.2

The bowler’s end umpire shall
- disallow all runs to the batting side
- return any not out batter to his/her original end
- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable

be scored.

18.8.2

If a batter is dismissed Run out, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the wicket was
fairly broken.

batters shall return to the wickets they had left, but only if they had not already crossed in running when the
ball became dead. If, however, any of the circumstances of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3 apply, the batters
shall return to their original ends.

19 BOUNDARIES
19.1 Determining the boundary of the field of play
19.1.1

Before the toss, the umpires shall determine the boundary of the field of play, which shall be fixed for the
duration of the match. See clause 2.3.2 (Consultation with Home Board).

19.1.2

The boundary shall be determined such that no part of any sight-screen, will, at any stage of the match, be
within the field of play.

19.1.3

The aim shall be to maximise the size of the playing area at each venue. With respect to the size of the
boundaries, no boundary shall be longer than 90 yards (82.29 meters), and no boundary should be shorter
than 57 yards ( 52.12 metres) from the centre of the pitch to be used.

19.1.4

At all times, there must be 3 yards (2.74 meters) from the boundary rope to the first solid object (advertising
boards/LEDs, photographers, cameramen, dug outs, covers, perimeter fence) for the player’s safety run off.

19.1.5

If the boundary is positioned less than 90 yards (82.29 meters) from the centre of the pitch, the boundary
rope cannot be set at a distance of more than 10 yards (9.14 meters) from the perimeter fence. The 10
yards shall be inclusive of the 3 yards (2.74 meters) provided for the player’s safety run off.

31

19.1.6

Any ground which has previously been approved to host international cricket which is unable to conform to
the minimum boundary dimension shall be exempt. In such cases the boundary shall be positioned so as to
maximise the size of the playing area.

19.2 Identifying and marking the boundary
19.2.1

All boundaries must be designated by a rope, or similar object of a minimum standard as authorised by the
ICC from time to time.

19.2.2

If the boundary is marked by means of an object that is in contact with the ground the boundary will be the
edge of the grounded part of the object which is nearest the pitch.

19.2.3

An obstacle within the field of play shall not be regarded as a boundary unless so determined by the umpires
before the toss. See clause 2.3.2 (Consultation with Home Board).

19.2.4

If an unauthorised person enters the playing arena and handles the ball, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall
be the sole judge of whether the boundary allowance should be scored or the ball be treated as still in play
or called dead ball if a batter is liable to be out as a result of the unauthorised person handling the ball. See
also clause 20.4.2.12 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball).

19.3 Restoring the boundary
If a solid object used to mark the boundary is disturbed for any reason, then:
19.3.1

the boundary shall be considered to be in its original position.

19.3.2

the object shall be returned to its original position as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall
be as soon as the ball is dead.

19.3.3

if some part of a fence or other marker has come within the field of play, that part shall be removed from the
field of play as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead.

19.4 Ball grounded beyond the boundary
19.4.1

The ball in play is grounded beyond the boundary if it touches
- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary;
- the ground beyond the boundary;
- any object that is grounded beyond the boundary.

19.4.2

The ball in play is to be regarded as being grounded beyond the boundary if
- a fielder, grounded beyond the boundary as in clause 19.5, touches the ball;
- a fielder, after catching the ball within the boundary, becomes grounded beyond the boundary while in
contact with the ball, before completing the catch.

19.5 Fielder grounded beyond the boundary
19.5.1

A fielder is grounded beyond the boundary if some part of his/her person is in contact with any of the
following:
- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary;
- the ground beyond the boundary;
- any object that is in contact with the ground beyond the boundary;
- another fielder who is grounded beyond the boundary.

19.5.2

A fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if his/her
final contact with the ground, before his/her first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the
bowler, was not entirely within the boundary.

32

19.6 Boundary allowances
19.6.1

6 runs shall be allowed for a boundary 6; and 4 runs for a boundary 4. See also clause 19.7.

19.7 Runs scored from boundaries
19.7.1

A boundary 6 will be scored if and only if the ball has been struck by the bat and is first grounded beyond the
boundary without having been in contact with the ground within the field of play. This shall apply even if the
ball has previously touched a fielder.

19.7.2

A boundary 4 will be scored when a ball that is grounded beyond the boundary
- whether struck by the bat or not, was first grounded within the boundary, or
- has not been struck by the bat.

19.7.3

When a boundary is scored, the batting side, except in the circumstances of clause 19.8, shall be awarded
whichever is the greater of

19.7.3.1

the allowance for the boundary

19.7.3.2

the runs completed by the batters together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the
instant the boundary is scored.

19.7.4

When the runs in clause 19.7.3.2 exceed the boundary allowance they shall replace the boundary allowance
for the purposes of clause 18.12.

19.7.5

The scoring of Penalty runs by either side is not affected by the scoring of a boundary.

19.8 Overthrow or wilful act of fielder
If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be
any runs for penalties awarded to either side
and the allowance for the boundary
and the runs completed by the batters, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of
the throw or act.
Clause 18.12.2 (Batter returning to wicket he/she has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act.

20 DEAD BALL
20.1 Ball is dead
20.1.1

The ball becomes dead when

20.1.1.1

it is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler.

20.1.1.2

a boundary is scored. See clause 19.7 (Runs scored from boundaries).

20.1.1.3

a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing the
dismissal.

20.1.1.4

whether played or not it becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batter or between items of
his/her clothing or equipment.

20.1.1.5

whether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batter or the clothing of an umpire.

20.1.1.6

there is an award of Penalty runs under either of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission) or 28.2

20.1.1.7

there is a contravention of clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side).

20.1.1.8

the match is concluded in any of the ways stated in clause 12.6 (Conclusion of match).

33

20.1.2

The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and
both batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play.

20.1.3

In a match where cameras are being used on or over the field of play (e.g. Spidercam), should a ball that
has been hit by the batter batter make contact, while still in play, with the camera, its apparatus or its cable,
either umpire shall call and signal ‘dead ball’. The ball shall not count as one of the over and no runs shall be
scored. If the delivery was called a No ball it shall count and the No ball penalty shall be applied. No other
runs (including penalty runs) apart from the No ball penalty shall be scored.

20.1.4

Should a ball thrown by a fielder make contact with a camera on or over the field of play, its apparatus or its
cable, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. Unless this was already a No ball or Wide, the ball shall
count as one of the over. All runs scored to that point shall count, plus the run in progress if the batters have
already crossed.

20.1.5

Refer also to paragraph 2.7 of Appendix D.

20.2 Ball finally settled
Whether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide.

20.3 Call of Over or Time
Neither the call of Over (see clause 17.4), nor the call of Time (see clause 12.2) is to be made until the ball is dead,
either under clauses 20.1 or 20.4.

20.4 Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball
20.4.1

When the ball has become dead under clause 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal Dead ball if
it is necessary to inform the players.

20.4.2

Where either umpire is required to call and signal Dead ball under 20.4.2.1 to 20.4.2.14, the ball will be
considered to be dead at the instant of the incident causing the ball to become dead. However, where the
playing conditions specifically provides for the call to be delayed, so as not to disadvantage the nonoffending side, under clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from the ball lawfully struck more than once), clause
41.2.1 (Unfair actions) and clause 42.1.2 (Unacceptable conduct), the ball will be considered to be dead at
the point of the call.
Either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball when

20.4.2.1

intervening in a case of unfair play.

20.4.2.2

a possibly serious injury to a player or umpire occurs.

20.4.2.3

leaving his/her normal position for consultation.

20.4.2.4

one or both bails fall from the striker’s wicket before the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball.

20.4.2.5

the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to play it.
Provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the ball shall not
count as one of the over.

20.4.2.6

the striker is distracted by any noise or movement or in any other way while preparing to receive, or
receiving a delivery. This shall apply whether the source of the distraction is within the match or outside it.
Note also clause 20.4.2.7. The ball shall not count as one of the over.

20.4.2.7

there is an instance of a deliberate attempt to distract under either of clauses 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to
distract striker) or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). The ball shall not count
as one of the over.

20.4.2.8

the bowler drops the ball accidentally before delivery.

20.4.2.9

the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering his/her delivery stride

20.4.2.10 the ball does not leave the bowler’s hand for any reason other than an attempt to run out the non-striker
under clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his/her ground early).

34

20.4.2.11 satisfied that the ball in play cannot be recovered.
20.4.2.12 he/she considers that either side has been disadvantaged by a person, animal or other object within the
field of play. However, if both umpires consider the ball would have reached the boundary regardless of
the intervention, the boundary should stand (see clause 19.2.4 – Identifying and marking the boundary).
20.4.2.13 the striker attempts to play the ball and no part of his/her person, whether grounded or raised, remains
within the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch).
20.4.2.14 required to do so under any of the Playing Conditions not included above.

20.5 Ball ceases to be dead
The ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his/her run-up or, if there is no runup, starts his/her bowling action.

20.6 Dead ball not to be revoked
Once the ball is dead, no revoking of any decision can bring the ball back into play for that delivery.

20.7 Dead ball; ball counting as one of over
20.7.1

When a ball which has been delivered is called dead or is to be considered dead then, other than as in
clause 20.7.2,

20.7.1.1

it will not count in the over if the striker has not had an opportunity to play it.

20.7.1.2

unless No ball or Wide ball has been called, it will be a valid ball if the striker has had an opportunity to
play it, except in the circumstances of clauses 20.4.2.6 and 24.4 ( Player returning without permission),
28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) and 41.5 (Deliberate distraction,
deception or obstruction of batter).

20.7.2

In clause 20.4.2.5, the ball will not count in the over only if both conditions of not attempting to play the ball
and having an adequate reason for not being ready are met. Otherwise the delivery will be a valid ball.

21 NO BALL
21.1 Mode of delivery
21.1.1

The umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the
wicket, and shall so inform the striker.
It is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his/her mode of delivery. In this case the
umpire shall call and signal No ball.

21.1.2

Underarm bowling shall not be permitted.

21.2 Fair delivery – the arm
For a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be delivered with an Illegal Bowling Action.
An Illegal Bowling Action is defined as a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees,
measured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released
(any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action).
Should either umpire or the ICC Match Referee suspect that a bowler has used an Illegal Bowling Action, they shall
complete the ICC Bowling Action Report Form at the conclusion of the match, as set out in the Illegal Bowling
Regulations.

21.3 Ball thrown or delivered underarm – action by umpires
21.3.1

If, in the opinion of either umpire, the ball has been thrown (where such mode of delivery does not
correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal No ball
and, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the reason for the call.

35

The bowler’s end umpire shall then
- warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply to that bowler
throughout the innings.
- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action.
- inform the batters at the wicket of what has occurred.
21.3.2

If either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is thrown (where such
mode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she
shall call and signal No ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the reason for the call.
The bowler’s end umpire shall then
- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. The over shall, if
applicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof
nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that
innings.
- inform the batters at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for
this action.

21.3.3

The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Match
Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned.

21.4 Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery
If the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, it is not a No ball and the
procedure stated in 21.3 shall not apply. However, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball under clause 20.4.2.9.

21.5 Fair delivery – the feet
For a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride
21.5.1

the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his/her stated
mode of delivery.

21.5.2

the bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised
- on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return crease described in
clause 21.5.1, and
- behind the popping crease.

The third umpire shall review television replays of the bowler’s front foot landing and, if he/she is satisfied that the
second requirement above has not been met, advise the bowler’s end umpire who shall in turn immediately call and
signal No ball. See clause 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball).

21.6 Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball
Either umpire shall call and signal No ball if, other than in an attempt to run out the non-striker under clause 38.3, the
bowler breaks the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and before completion of the stride after the
delivery stride. This shall include any clothing or other object that falls from his/her person and breaks the wicket.

21.7 Ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or pitching off the pitch
The umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having
previously touched bat or person of the striker,
- bounces more than once
- or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease.

36

- or pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch) before it reaches the line of the
striker’s wicket.

21.8 Ball causing the striker to leave the pitch or ball coming to rest in front of striker’s
wicket
If a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket, or is so far from the pitch that
the striker would need to leave the pitch to attempt to play the ball (see clause 25.6 – Striker’s right to play the ball)
without having previously touched the bat or person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and
immediately call and signal Dead ball.

21.9 Fielder intercepting a delivery
If, except in the circumstances of clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper) a ball delivered by the bowler, makes
contact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes
the striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball.

21.10 Ball bouncing over head height of striker
See clauses 22.1.1.2 and 41.6.1.7.

21.11 Call of No ball for infringement of other Playing Conditions
In addition to the instances above, No ball is to be called and signalled as required by the following clauses:
Clause 27.3 – Position of wicket-keeper
Clause 28.4 – Limitation of on side fielders
Clause 28.5 – Fielders not to encroach on pitch
Clause 41.6 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries
Clause 41.7 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries
Clause 41.8 – Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball.

21.12 Revoking a call of No ball
An umpire shall revoke the call of No ball if Dead ball is called under any of Laws 20.4.2.4, 20.4.2.5, 20.4.2.6,
20.4.2.8 or 20.4.2.10 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball).

21.13 No ball to over-ride Wide
A call of No ball shall over-ride the call of Wide ball at any time. See clauses 22.1 (Judging a Wide) and 22.2 (Call
and signal of Wide ball).

21.14 Ball not dead
The ball does not become dead on the call of No ball.

21.15 Penalty for a No ball
A penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of No ball. Unless the call is revoked, the penalty shall
stand even if a batter is dismissed. It shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and any
other runs awarded for penalties.

21.16 Runs resulting from a No ball – how scored
The one run penalty shall be scored as a No ball extra and shall be debited against the bowler. If other Penalty runs
have been awarded to either side these shall be scored as stated in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs). Any runs completed
by the batters or any boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat;
otherwise they shall also be scored as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate.

37

21.17 No ball not to count
A No ball shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls).

21.18 Out from a No ball
When No ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 34 (Hit
the ball twice), clause 37 (Obstructing the field) or clause 38 (Run out).

21.19 Free Hit
21.19.1 In addition to the above, the delivery following a No ball called (all modes of No ball) shall be a free hit for
whichever batter is facing it. If the delivery for the free hit is not a legitimate delivery (any kind of No ball or a
Wide) then the next delivery will become a free hit for whichever batter is facing it.
21.19.2 For any free hit, the striker can be dismissed only under the circumstances that apply for a No ball, even if
the delivery for the free hit is called Wide.
21.19.3 Neither field changes nor the exchange of individuals between fielding positions are permitted for free hit
deliveries unless:
21.19.3.1 There is a change of striker (the provisions of clause 41.2 shall apply), or
21.19.3.2 The No ball was the result of a fielding restriction breach, in which case the field may be changed to the
extent of correcting the breach.
21.19.4 For clarity, the bowler can change his/her mode of delivery for the free hit delivery. In such circumstances
clause 21.1 shall apply.
21.19.5 The umpires will signal a free hit by (after the normal No ball signal) extending one arm straight upwards and
moving it in a circular motion.

22 WIDE BALL
22.1 Judging a Wide
22.1.1

If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the
definition in clause 22.1.2

22.1.1.1

the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the striker
standing in a normal batting position.

22.1.1.2

the ball passes above the head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease.

22.1.2

The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for him to be
able to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke.

22.1.3

Umpires are instructed to apply very strict and consistent interpretation in regard to this clause in order to
prevent negative bowling wide of the wicket.

22.2 Call and signal of Wide ball
If the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a Wide he/she shall call and signal Wide ball as soon as the ball passes the
striker’s wicket. It shall, however, be considered to have been a Wide from the instant that the bowler entered
his/herdelivery stride, even though it cannot be called Wide until it passes the striker’s wicket.

22.3 Revoking a call of Wide ball
22.3.1

The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if there is any contact between the ball and the striker’s bat or
person before the ball comes into contact with any fielder.

22.3.2

The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if a delivery is called a No ball. See clause 21.13 (No ball to
over-ride Wide).

38

22.4 Delivery not a Wide
22.4.1

The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to
pass wide of him, as defined in clause 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by
means of a normal cricket stroke.

22.4.2

The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide if the ball touches the striker’s bat or person, but
only as the ball passes the striker.

22.5 Ball not dead
The ball does not become dead on the call of Wide ball.

22.6 Penalty for a Wide
A penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of Wide ball. Unless the call is revoked, under clause
22.3, this penalty shall stand even if abatter is dismissed, and shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any
boundary allowance and any other runs awarded for penalties.

22.7 Runs resulting from a Wide – how scored
All runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance, together with the penalty for the Wide, shall be scored as
Wide balls. Apart from any award of 5 Penalty runs, all runs resulting from a Wide shall be debited against the bowler.

22.8 Wide not to count
A Wide shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls).

22.9 Out from a Wide
When Wide ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 35 (Hit
wicket), clause 37 (Obstructing the field), clause 38 (Run out) or clause 39 (Stumped).

23 BYE AND LEG BYE
23.1 Byes
If the ball, delivered by the bowler, not being a Wide, passes the striker without touching his/her bat or person, any
runs completed by the batters from that delivery, or a boundary allowance, shall be credited as Byes to the batting
side. Additionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred.

23.2 Leg byes
23.2.1

If a ball delivered by the bowler first strikes the person of the striker, runs shall be scored only if the umpire
is satisfied that the striker has
either attempted to play the ball with the bat
or tried to avoid being hit by the ball.

23.2.2
23.2.2.1

If the umpire is satisfied that either of these conditions has been met runs shall be scored as follows.
If there is
either no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person, or
only inadvertent contact with the striker’s bat or person
any runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker in the
case of subsequent contact with his/her bat but otherwise to the batting side as in clause 23.2.3.

23.2.2.2
23.2.3

If the striker wilfully makes a lawful second strike, clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once) and
clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once) shall apply.
The runs in clause 23.2.2.1, unless credited to the striker, shall be scored as Leg byes.

39

Additionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for the No ball shall be incurred.

23.3 Leg byes not to be awarded
If in the circumstance of clause 23.2.1 the umpire considers that neither of the conditions therein has been met, then
Leg byes shall not be awarded.
If the ball does not become dead for any other reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball
reaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run.
The umpire shall then:
- disallow all runs to the batting side;
- return any not out batter to his/her original end;
- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable;
- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging
to the fielding side).

24 FIELDER’S ABSENCE; SUBSTITUTES
24.1 Substitute fielders
24.1.1

The umpires shall allow a substitute fielder

24.1.1.1

if they are satisfied that a fielder has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the match, or

24.1.1.2

for any other wholly acceptable reason.
In all other circumstances, a substitute is not allowed.

24.1.2

A substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicket-keeper only with the consent of the
umpires. Note, however, clause 42.4.1.

24.1.3

A nominated player may bowl or field even though a substitute has previously acted for him, subject to
clauses 24.2 and 24.3.

24.1.4

Squad members of the fielding or batting team who are not playing in the match and who are not acting as
substitute fielders shall be required to wear a team training bib whilst on the playing area (including the area
between the boundary and the perimeter fencing).

24.2 Fielder absent or leaving the field of play
24.2.1

A player going briefly outside the boundary while carrying out any duties as a fielder is not absent from the
field of play nor, for the purposes of this clause, is he/she to be regarded as having left the field of play.

24.2.2

If a fielder fails to take the field at the start of play or at any later time, or leaves the field during play,

24.2.2.1

an umpire shall be informed of the reason for this absence.

24.2.2.2

He/she shall not thereafter come on to the field of play during a session of play without the consent of the
umpire. See clause 24.4. The umpire shall give such consent as soon as it is practicable.

24.2.3
24.2.3.1

If a player is absent from the field for longer than 8 minutes, the following restrictions shall apply to their
future participation in the match:
The player shall not be permitted to bowl in the match until he/she has either been able to field, or his/her
team has subsequently been batting, for the total length of playing time for which the player was absent
(hereafter referred to as Penalty time). A player’s unexpired Penalty time shall be limited to a maximum of
40 minutes. If any unexpired Penalty time remains at the end of an innings, it is carried forward to the next
and subsequent innings of the match.

40

24.2.3.2

The player shall not be permitted to bat in the match until his/her team’s batting innings has been in
progress for the length of playing time that is equal to the unexpired Penalty time carried forward from the
previous innings. However, once his/her side has lost five wickets in its batting innings, he/she may bat
immediately. If any unexpired penalty time remains at the end of that batting innings, it is carried forward to
the next and subsequent innings of the match.

24.2.4

If the player leaves the field before having served all of his/her Penalty time, the balance is carried forward
as unserved Penalty time.

24.2.5

On any occasion of absence, the amount of playing time for which the player is off the field shall be added to
any Penalty time that remains unserved, subject to a maximum cumulative Penalty time of 40 minutes, and
that player shall not bowl until all of his/her Penalty time has been served.

24.2.6

For the purposes of clauses 24.2.3.1 and 24.2.3.2, playing time shall comprise the time play is in progress
excluding intervals between innings. For clarity, a player’s Penalty time will continue to expire after he/she is
dismissed, for the remainder of his/her team’s batting innings.

24.2.7

If there is an unscheduled break in play, the stoppage time shall count as Penalty time served, provided that,

24.2.7.1

the fielder who was on the field of play at the start of the break either takes the field on the resumption of
play, or his/her side is now batting.

24.2.7.2

25 BATTER’S INNINGS
25.1 Eligibility to act as a batter
Only a nominated player may bat and, subject to clause 25.3, may do so even though a substitute fielder has
previously acted for him.

25.2 Commencement of a batter innings
The innings of the first two batters, and that of any new batter on the resumption of play after a call of Time, shall
commence at the call of Play. At any other time, a batter innings shall be considered to have commenced when that
batter first steps onto the field of play.

25.3 Restriction on batter commencing an innings
25.3.1

If a member of the batting side has unserved Penalty time, (see clause 24.2.7), that player shall not be

expired, that player may bat after his/her side has lost 5 wickets.

25.3.2

A member of the batting side’s Penalty time is served during Playing time. In the event of an unscheduled
stoppage, the stoppage time after the batter notifies an umpire in person that he/she is able to participate
shall count as Penalty time served.

25.4 Batter retiring
25.4.1

A batter may retire at any time during his/her innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing
play to proceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batter retiring.

25.4.2

If a batter retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batter is entitled to resume
his/her innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batter is to be recorded as ‘Retired – not out’.

25.4.3

If a batter retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, the innings of that batter may be resumed
only with the consent of the opposing captain. If for any reason his/her innings is not resumed, that batter is
to be recorded as ‘Retired – out’.

25.4.4

interference from the wicket-keeper or any other fielder (see clause 27.5 – Restrictions on actions of wicket-keeper
and clause 27.6 – Interference with wicket-keeper by striker).
However, the striker may only attempt to play the ball if some of his/her bat or person, whether grounded or raised,

26.1.2.1

If approved by the umpires, the use of the square for practice on any day of any match will be restricted to
any netted practice area or bowling strips specifically prepared on the edge of the square for that purpose.

42

26.1.2.2

Bowling practice on the bowling strips referred to above shall also be permitted during the interval (and
change of innings if not the interval) unless the umpires consider that, in the prevailing conditions of
ground and weather, it will be detrimental to the surface of the square.

26.2 Practice on the outfield
26.2.1

On any day of the match, all forms of practice are permitted on the outfield
– before the start of play;
– after the close of play; and
– during the interval or between innings
providing the umpires are satisfied that such practice will not cause significant deterioration in the condition
of the outfield.

the following conditions are met:
- only the fielders as defined in paragraph 7 of Appendix A participate in such practice.
- no ball other than the match ball is used for this practice.
- no bowling practice takes place in the area between the square and the boundary in a direction parallel to
the match pitch.
- the umpires are satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.3 (The match ball changing its
condition) or 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side).
Bowling a ball, using a short run up to a player in the outfield is not to be regarded as bowling practice but
shall be subject to the other conditions in this clause.

26.3 Trial run-up

- warn the player that the practice is not permitted;
- inform the other umpire and, as soon as practicable, both captains of the reason for this action.

26.4.1.1

26.4.2

If the contravention is by a batter at the wicket, the umpire shall inform the other batter and each incoming
batter that the warning has been issued. The warning shall apply to the team of that player throughout the
match.
If during the match there is any further contravention by any player of that team, the umpire shall
- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side;
- inform the other umpire, the scorers and, as soon as practicable, both captains, and, if the contravention is
during play, the batters at the wicket.

43

27 THE WICKET-KEEPER
27.1 Protective equipment
The wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. If these are worn, they are to
be regarded as part of his/her person for the purposes of clause 28.2 (Fielding the ball). If by the wicket-keeper’s
actions and positioning when the ball comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that he/she will not be able to carry
out the normal duties of a wicket-keeper, he/she shall forfeit this right and also the right to be recognised as a wicketkeeper for the purposes of clauses 33.2 (A fair catch), 39 (Stumped), 28.1 (Protective equipment), 28.4 (Limitation of
on-side fielders) and 28.5 (Fielders not to encroach on pitch).

27.2 Gloves

If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing
material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks.

27.2.3

The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to
the top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. See
paragraph 3 of Appendix B.

27.3 Position of wicket-keeper
27.3.1

The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the moment the ball comes
into play until a ball delivered by the bowler
touches the bat or person of the striker; or
passes the wicket at the striker’s end; or
the striker attempts a run.

27.3.2

In the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this clause, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No
ball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball.

27.4 Movement by wicket-keeper
27.4.1

After the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the wicket-keeper significantly
alters his/her position in relation to the striker’s wicket, except for the following:

27.4.1.1

movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it brings him within reach of the
wicket.

27.4.1.2

lateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been delivered.

27.4.1.3

movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his/her actions suggest he/she
intends to play. However the provisions of clause 27.3 shall apply.

27.4.2

In the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and signal Dead balland
inform the other umpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then:

27.4.2.1

award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable

27.4.2.2

award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side

27.4.2.3

inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action.

27.4.2.4

inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred.
The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the
ICC Match Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the wicketkeeper concerned.

44

27.5 Restriction on actions of wicket-keeper
If, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play the ball and to guard
his/herwicket, clause 20.4.2.6 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball) shall apply.
If, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was wilful, then clause 41.1
(Deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply.

27.6 Interference with wicket-keeper by striker
If, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of his/her wicket, the striker interferes with the wicket-keeper,
he/she shall not be out except as provided for in clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught).

28 THE FIELDER

protection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires.

28.2 Fielding the ball
28.2.1

A fielder may field the ball with any part of his/her person (see paragraph 12 of Appendix A), except as in
clause 28.2.1.2. However, he/she will be deemed to have fielded the ball illegally if, while the ball is in play
he/she wilfully

28.2.1.1

28.2.1.2

Extends his/her clothing with his/her hands and uses this to field the ball.

If a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and
- the penalty for a No ball or a Wide shall stand.
- any runs completed by the batters shall be credited to the batting side, together with the run in progress if
the batters had already crossed at the instant of the offence.
- the ball shall not count as one of the over.
In addition the umpire shall:
- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side.
- inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action.
- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred.

28.3 Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side
28.3.1

Protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground, above the surface except
behind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of stumps.

28.3.2

If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1 the ball shall
immediately become Dead and, unless 28.3.3. applies:
the umpire shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable

45

,
the umpire shall award of 5 Penalty runs to the batting side;
28.3.2.1

28.3.3

any runs completed by the batters before the ball strikes the protective helmet shall be scored, together
with the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the ball striking the protective
helmet.
If the ball while in play strikes a protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, and the
circumstances of clause 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (Hit the ball twice) apply, the
umpire shall:
- disallow all runs to the batting side

28.4 Limitation of on side fielders
28.4.1

At the instant of delivery, there may not be more than 5 fielders on the leg side.

28.4.2

At the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper,
behind the popping crease on the on side. A fielder will be considered to be behind the popping crease
unless the whole of his/her person whether grounded or in the air is in front of this line.

28.4.3

In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No
ball.

28.5 Fielders not to encroach on pitch
While the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person, or has passed the striker’s
bat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of his/her person grounded on or extended over the pitch.
In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the bowler’s end umpire shall
call and signal No ball as soon as possible after delivery of the ball. Note, however, clause 27.3 (Position of wicketkeeper).

28.6 Movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper
28.6.1

28.6.1.1

minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker’s wicket.

28.6.3.3

inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action.

28.6.3.4

46

The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the
ICC Match Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder
concerned.

28.6.4

Note also the provisions of clause 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker). See also clause 27.4
(Movement by wicket-keeper).

28.7 Restrictions on the placement of fielders
28.7.1

In addition to the restrictions contained in clause 28.4 above, further fielding restrictions shall apply to certain
overs in each innings. The nature of such fielding restrictions and the overs during which they shall apply are

28.7.2

Subject to 28.7.6 below these additional fielding restrictions shall apply to the first 6 overs of each innings
(Powerplay overs).

28.7.3

Two semi-circles shall be drawn on the field of play. The semi-circles shall have as their centre the middle
stump at either end of the pitch. The radius of each of the semi-circles shall be 30 yards (27.43 metres). The
semi-circles shall be linked by two parallel straight lines drawn on the field (see paragraph 2 of Appendix C).
These fielding restriction areas should be marked by continuous painted white lines or ‘dots’ at 5 yard (4.57
metres) intervals, each ‘dot’ to be covered by a white plastic or rubber (but not metal) disc measuring 7
inches (18 cm) in diameter.

28.7.4

During the Powerplay overs only two fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding restriction area at the
instant of delivery.

28.7.5

During the non Powerplay overs, no more than 5 fielders shall be permitted outside the fielding restriction
area referred to in clause 28.7.3 above.

28.7.6

In circumstances when the number of overs of the batting team is reduced, the number of Powerplay overs

28.7.7

If an innings is interrupted during an over and if on the resumption of play, due to the reduced number of
overs of the batting team, the required number of Powerplay overs have already been bowled, the remaining
deliveries in the over to be completed shall not be subject to the fielding restrictions.

28.7.8

In the event of an infringement of any of the above fielding restrictions, the square leg umpire shall call and

29 THE WICKET IS BROKEN
29.1 Wicket put down
The wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or one or more
stumps is removed from the ground.

29.2

Breaking the wicket fairly

47

29.2.1 The wicket is broken fairly if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps or a stump is struck out of
the ground.
29.2.1.1 by the ball,
29.2.1.2 by the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that he/she is holding,
29.2.1.3 for the purpose of this clause only, by the striker's bat not in hand, or by any part of the bat which has

guard becoming detached from his/her person,
29.2.1.5 by a fielder with his/her hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the
hand of the arm so used.
29.1.1.6

The wicket is also broken fairly if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of the ground as in clause 29.2.1.5.

29.2.2 The disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete removal from the top of
the stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the stumps this shall be regarded as complete removal.

29.3 One bail off
If one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of putting the wicket down to remove the remaining bail or to
strike or pull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the ways stated in clause 29.2.

29.4 Remaking wicket
If a wicket is broken or put down while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the ball is dead.
See clause 20 (Dead ball). Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play,
- replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps.
- put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood.

29.5 Dispensing with bails
If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with clause 8.5 (Dispensing with bails), it is for the
umpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been broken.
29.5.1 After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been broken fairly if the umpire concerned is satisfied that
the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of his/her clothing or equipment as
described in clauses 29.2.1.2, 29.2.1.3 or 29.2.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in clause 29.2.1.5.
29.5.2 If the wicket has already been broken or put down, clause 29.5.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still in the
ground. Any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with clause 29.4, in order to have an opportunity
of breaking the wicket fairly.

30 BATTER OUT OF HIS/HER GROUND
30.1 When out of his/her ground
30.1.1

A batter shall be considered to be out of his/her ground unless some part of his/her person or bat is
grounded behind the popping crease at that end.

30.1.2

However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his/her ground if, in running or diving towards his/her
ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his/her person or bat beyond the popping crease,
there is subsequent loss of contact between the ground and any part of his/her person or bat, or between
the bat and person.

30.2 Which is a batter ground
30.2.1

If only one batter is within a ground, it is his/her ground and will remain so even if he/she is later joined there
by the other batter.

48

30.2.2

If both batters are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the ground belongs to the
batter who remains in it.

30.2.3

If there is no batter in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batter is nearer to it, or, if the
batters are level, to whichever batter was nearer to it immediately prior to their drawing level.

30.2.4

If a ground belongs to one batter then the other ground belongs to the other batter, irrespective of his/her
position.

30.3 Position of non-striker
The non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that
from which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire.

31 APPEALS
31.1 Umpire not to give batter out without an appeal
Neither umpire shall give a batter out, even though he/she may be out under these Playing Conditions, unless
appealed to by a fielder. This shall not debar a batter who is out under these Playing Conditions from leaving the
wicket without an appeal having been made. Note, however, the provisions of clause 31.7.

31.2 Batter dismissed
A batter is dismissed if he/she is
either given out by an umpire, on appeal
or out under these Playing Conditions and leaves the wicket as in clause 31.1.

31.3 Timing of appeals
For an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins his/her run-up or, if there is no run-up,
his/herbowling action to deliver the next ball, and before Time has been called.
The call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided Time has not
been called. See clauses 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an over).

31.4 Appeal “How’s That?”
An appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out.

31.5 Answering appeals
The striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of clauses 35 (Hit wicket), 39 (Stumped) or 38
(Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. The bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals.
When an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his/her jurisdiction.
When a batter has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with clause 31.3, if
it is on a further matter and is within his/her jurisdiction.

31.6 Consultation by umpires
Each umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his/her own jurisdiction. If an umpire is doubtful about any point
that the other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and
shall then give the decision. If, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out.

31.7 Batter leaving the wicket under a misapprehension
An umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a
misapprehension of being out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by
the fielding side and shall recall the batter.

49

A batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is
the final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field.

31.8 Withdrawal of an appeal
The captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose
jurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision
and recall the batter.
The withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the
innings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field.

32 BOWLED
32.1 Out Bowled
32.1.1

The striker is out Bowled if his/her wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball,
even if it first touches the striker’s bat or person.

32.1.2

However, the striker shall not be out Bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has been in contact with any
other player or an umpire. The striker will, however, be subject to clauses 37 (Obstructing the field), 38 (Run
out) and 39 (Stumped).

32.2 Bowled to take precedence
The striker is out Bowled if his/her wicket is broken as in clause 32.1, even though a decision against him for any
other method of dismissal would be justified.

33 CAUGHT
33.1 Out Caught
The striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his/her bat without having
previously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in
clause 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground.

33.2 A fair catch
33.2.1

A catch will be fair only if, in every case
either the ball, at any time
or any fielder in contact with the ball,
is not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. Note clauses 19.4 (Ball grounded
beyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the boundary).

33.2.2

Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies:

33.2.2.1

the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the ground, or
is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a fielder, or lodges
accidentally in a fielder’s clothing.

33.2.2.2

a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only if it has not
been grounded since it was first struck. See clause 34 (Hit the ball twice).

33.2.2.3

a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder or the other batter.

33.2.2.4

a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions in clause
33.2.1 are met.

33.2.2.5

the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the umpires.

50

33.3 Making a catch
The act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and
shall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his/her own movement.

33.5 Caught to take precedence

34.1.1

The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his/her person or is struck
by his/her bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker wilfully strikes it again with

whether it is the first strike or a second or subsequent strike. The act of receiving the ball shall extend both
to playing at the ball and to striking the ball more than once in defence of his/her wicket.

37.1.3

This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called.

37.1.4

For the avoidance of doubt, if an umpire feels that a batter, in running between the wickets, has significantly

out, the batter should, on appeal, be given out, obstructing the field. It shall not be relevant whether a run out
would have occurred or not.

37.5.1

unless the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out Caught, any runs completed by the
batters before the offence shall be scored, together with any one-run Penalty for No ball or wide, or any
other award of 5 Penalty Runs to either side. See clauses 18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs
scored when a batter is dismissed).

37.5.2

until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the nonstriker is liable to be Run out by the bowler attempting to run him/her out. In these circumstances, the
non- striker will be out Run out if he/she is out of his/her ground when his/her wicket is broken by the
bowler throwing the ball at the wicket or by the bowler’s hand holding the ball, whether or not the ball
is subsequently delivered.

(Conclusion of match), 16.6 (Winning hit or extras) and 22.2 (Call and signal of Wide ball) mean that if the penalty for
a Wide concludes the match, then a stumping is not possible, but the one-run penalty for the Wide remains.

player, not covered by these Playing Conditions, is unfair, he/she shall call and signal Dead ball, if
appropriate, as soon as it becomes clear that the call will not disadvantage the non-offending side, and
report the matter to the other umpire.

41.2.1.1 If this is a first offence by that side, the bowler’s end umpire shall then

56

- summon the offending player’s captain and issue a first and final warning which shall apply to all members

considered appropriate against the player concerned.

41.3 The match ball – changing its condition
41.3.1

The umpires shall make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball. In addition, they shall immediately
inspect the ball if they suspect anyone of attempting to change the condition of the ball, except as permitted
in clause 41.3.2.

41.3.2

It is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball.
Except in carrying out his/her normal duties, a batter is not allowed to damage the ball other than, when the
ball is in play, in striking it with the bat. See also clause 5.4.3 (Damage to the ball).

41.3.4

If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or
members of either side, or that its condition is inconsistent with the use it has received, they shall consider
that there has been a contravention of this clause and decide together whether they can identify the
player(s) responsible for such conduct.

41.3.5

If it is possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires shall;

41.3.5.1

41.3.5.2

Subject to clause 41.3.7 below, change the ball forthwith.
41.3.5.1.1

If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly
changed by a member or members of the fielding side, the batter at the wicket
shall choose the replacement ball from a selection of six other balls of various
degrees of usage (including a new ball) and of the same brand as the ball in use
prior to the contravention.

41.3.5.1.2

If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly
changed by a member or members of the batting side, the umpires shall select
and bring into use immediately, a ball which shall have wear comparable to that
of the previous ball immediately prior to the contravention.

Additionally, the bowler’s end umpire shall
41.3.5.2.1 – award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side.
41.3.5.2.2 – if appropriate, inform the batters at the wicket and the captain of the fielding side that
the ball has been changed and the reason for their action; and

57

captain deemed to be the player responsible for the contravention.

41.4 Deliberate attempt to distract striker
41.4.1

It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while he/she is preparing to receive or
receiving a delivery.

41.4.2

If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and
signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall
- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side.
- inform the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting
side of the reason for the action.
Neither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery and the ball shall not count as one of the over. However,
if either umpire had reason to call and signal No ball, he/she shall do so regardless of the attempt to distract,
and this call shall stand.
The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is
considered appropriate against the fielder concerned.

41.5 Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter
41.5.1

In addition to clause 41.4, it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive
or obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball.

41.5.2

It is for either one of the umpires to decide whether any distraction, deception or obstruction is wilful or not.

41.5.3

If either umpire considers that a fielder has caused or attempted to cause such a distraction, deception or
obstruction, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for
the call.

The bowler’s end umpire shall;
- Signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable.
- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side.

58

- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action and as soon as practicable inform the
captain of the batting side.
41.5.7

The ball shall not count as one of the over.

41.5.8

Any runs completed by the batters before the offence shall be scored, together with any runs for penalties
awarded to either side. Additionally, the run in progress shall be scored whether or not the batters had
already crossed at the instant of the offence.

41.5.9

The batters at the wicket shall decide which of them is to face the next delivery.

41.5.10 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is
considered appropriate against the fielder concerned.

41.6 Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries
41.6.1

Notwithstanding clause 41.6.2, the bowling of short pitched deliveries is dangerous if the bowler’s end
umpire considers that, taking into consideration the skill of the striker, by their speed, length, height and
direction they are likely to inflict physical injury on him. The fact that the striker is wearing protective
equipment shall be disregarded.
In the first instance the umpire decides that the bowling of short pitched deliveries has become dangerous
under 41.6.1

41.6.1.1

The umpire shall call and signal No ball, and when the ball is dead, caution the bowler and inform the other
umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to
that bowler throughout the innings.

41.6.1.2

If there is a second instance, the umpire shall repeat the above procedure and indicate to the bowler that
this is a final warning, which shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings.

41.6.1.3

Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall
- call and signal No ball
- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately
from bowling
- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action.
The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings.
If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any
part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over.
- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side.
The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as
is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned.

41.6.1.4

A bowler shall be limited to one fast short-pitched delivery per over.

41.6.1.5

A fast short-pitched delivery is defined as a ball, which passes or would have passed above the shoulder
height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease.

41.6.1.6

The umpire at the bowler’s end shall advise the bowler and the batter on strike when each fast short
pitched delivery has been bowled.

41.6.1.7

In addition, a ball that passes above head height of the batter, standing upright at the popping crease, that
prevents him from being able to hit it with his/her bat by means of a normal cricket stroke shall be called a
Wide. See also clause 22.1.1.2

41.6.1.7.1
41.6.1.8

For the avoidance of doubt any fast short pitched delivery that is called a Wide under this clause shall
also count as one of the allowable short pitched deliveries in that over.

In the event of a bowler bowling more than one fast short-pitched delivery in an over as defined in clause
41.6.1.5 above, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall call and signal No ball on each occasion. A differential

59

signal shall be used to signify a fast short pitched delivery. The umpire shall call and signal ‘No ball’ and
then tap the head with the other hand.
41.6.1.9

If a bowler delivers a second fast short pitched ball in an over, the umpire, after the call of No ball and
when the ball is dead, shall caution the bowler, inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and
the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. This caution shall apply throughout the innings.

41.6.1.10 If there is a second instance of the bowler being No balled in the innings for bowling more than one fast
short pitched delivery in an over, the umpire shall advise the bowler that this is his/her final warning for the
innings.
41.6.1.11 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall
- call and signal No ball
- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately
from bowling
- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action.
The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings.
If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any
part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over.
- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side.
The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as
is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned.
41.6.2

Should the umpires initiate the caution and warning procedures set out in clauses 41.6.1.3, 41.6.1.9 and
41.7, such cautions and warnings are not to be cumulative.

41.7 Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries
41.7.1

Any delivery, which passes or would have passed, without pitching, above waist height of the striker
standing upright at the popping crease, is to be deemed to be unfair, whether or not it is likely to inflict
physical injury on the striker. If the bowler bowls such a delivery the umpire shall immediately call and signal
No ball.
If, in the opinion of the umpire, such a delivery is considered likely to inflict physical injury on the batter by its
speed and direction, it shall be considered dangerous. When the ball is dead the umpire shall caution the
bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. The umpire shall also inform the other umpire, the
captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler
throughout the innings.

41.7.2

Should there be any further instance (where a dangerous non-pitching delivery is bowled and is considered
likely to inflict physical injury on the batter) by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall

Match Referee awarding a match).

66

42.3.2

If both captains refuse to carry out instructions under 42.2.2.3 in respect of the same incident, the umpires
shall instruct the players to leave the field. The match is not concluded as in clause 16.2 and there shall be
no result under clause 16.

42.4 Additional points relating to Level 4 offences
42.4.1

If a player, while acting as wicket-keeper, commits a Level 4 offence, clause 24.1.2 shall not apply, meaning
that only a nominated player may keep wicket, even if another fielder becomes injured or ill and is replaced
by a substitute.

42.4.2

A nominated player who has a substitute will also suffer the penalty for any Level 4 offence committed by
the substitute. However, only the substitute will be reported under clause 42.2.2.5.

7.3

Fielder is one of the 11 or fewer players who together represent the fielding side on the field of play. This
definition includes not only both the bowler and the wicket-keeper but also nominated players who are
legitimately on the field of play, together with players legitimately acting as substitutes for absent nominated
players. It excludes any nominated player who is absent from the field of play, or who has been absent from
the field of play and who has not yet obtained the umpire’s permission to return.
A player going briefly outside the boundary in the course of discharging his/her duties as a fielder is not
absent from the field of play nor, for the purposes of clause 24.2 (Fielder absent or leaving the field of play),
is he/she to be regarded as having left the field of play.

8 Substitutes and Concussion Replacements
8.1

A Substitute is a player who takes the place of a fielder on the field of play, but does not replace the player
for whom he/she substitutes on that side’s list of nominated players. A substitute’s activities are limited to
fielding.

8.2

A Concussion Replacement is a player who takes the place of a player who has been replaced in accordance
with the process set out in clause 1.2.7, and who for the remainder of the match replaces that player on that
side’s list of nominated players, being able to take a full part in the match (subject to such restrictions as may
be imposed by the ICC Match Referee in accordance with clause 1.2.7.4

8.3

A Concussion Replacement Request is the notification made to the ICC Match Referee in accordance with the
process set out in clause 1.2.7.3

8.4

The Team Medical Representative is the individual designated as having responsibility for the assessment of
any head or neck injury sustained by a player as set out in clause 1.2.7.2

9 Bowlers
9.1

Over the wicket / round the wicket – if, as the bowler runs up between the wicket and the return crease, the
wicket is on the same side as his/her bowling arm, he/she is bowling over the wicket. If the return crease is on
the same side as his/her bowling arm, he/she is bowling round the wicket.

9.2

Delivery swing is the motion of the bowler’s arm during which he/she normally releases the ball for a delivery.

9.3

Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the ball is released or not. It
starts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.
The stride after the delivery stride is completed when the next foot lands, i.e. when the back foot of the
delivery stride lands again.

72

9.4

The Illegal Bowling Regulations are the ICC’s regulations governing Illegal Bowling Actions.

9.5

An Illegal Bowling Action is a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees,
measured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is
released (any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling
Action).

9.6

Elbow Extension means the motion that occurs when a bowler's arm moves from a flexed (bent) position at
the elbow, to a more extended (straight) position (full Elbow Extension occurs when the arm is straight).

9.7

Elbow Hyperextension is the motion that occurs when a bowler's elbow extends beyond the straight position.

9.8

The ICC Bowling Action Report Form is the form provided for by Article 3 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations,
by which an umpire and/or the ICC Match Referee may submit a report relating to a suspected Illegal Bowling
Action.

10 The ball
10.1

The ball is struck/strikes the ball unless specifically defined otherwise, mean ‘the ball is struck by the
bat’/‘strikes the ball with the bat’.

10.2

Full-pitch describes a ball delivered by the bowler that reaches or passes the striker without having touched
the ground. Sometimes described as non-pitching.

11 Runs
11.1

A run to be disallowed is one that in these Playing Conditions should not have been taken. It is not only to
be cancelled but the batters are to be returned to their original ends.

11.2

A run not to be scored is one that is not illegal, but is not recognised as a properly executed run. It is not a
run that has been made, so the question of cancellation does not arise. The loss of the run so attempted is not
a disallowance and the batters will not be returned to their original ends on that account.

12 The person
12.1

Person; A player’s person is his/her physical person (flesh and blood) together with any clothing or legitimate
external protective equipment that he/she is wearing except, in the case of a batter, his/her bat.
A hand, whether gloved or not, that is not holding the bat is part of the batter’s person.
No item of clothing or equipment is part of the player’s person unless it is attached to him/her.
For a batter, a glove being held but not worn is part of his/her person.
For a fielder, an item of clothing or equipment he is holding in his/her hand or hands is not part of his/her
person.

12.2

Clothing – anything that a player is wearing, including such items as spectacles or jewellery, that is not
classed as external protective equipment is classed as clothing, even though he/she may be wearing some
items of apparel, which are not visible, for protection. A bat being carried by a batter does not come within this
definition of clothing.

12.3

Hand for batter or wicket-keeper shall include both the hand itself and the whole of a glove worn on the hand.

1.4

Protection and repair

1.4.1

The surface of the blade may be treated with non-solid materials to improve resistance to moisture
penetration and/or mask natural blemishes in the appearance of the wood. Save for the purpose of giving a
homogeneous appearance by masking natural blemishes, such treatment shall not materially alter the colour
of the blade.

1.4.2

Materials can be used for protection and repair as stated in clause 5.4 and are additional to the blade. Note
however clause 5.6.
Any such material shall not extend over any part of the back of the blade except in the case of clause 5.4.1
and then only when it is applied as a continuous wrapping covering the damaged area.
The repair material shall not extend along the length of the blade more than 0.79 in/2.0 cm in each direction
beyond the limits of the damaged area. Where used as a continuous binding, any overlapping shall not
breach the maximum of 0.04 in/0.1 cm in total thickness.
The use of non-solid material which when dry forms a hard layer more than 0.004 in/0.01 cm in thickness is
not permitted.

1.4.3

1.1

General
Minimum requirements for use of DRS and appointment of third umpire

1.1.1

Save with the express written consent of the ICC General Manager – Cricket, the Home Board shall ensure
the live television broadcast of all T20I matches played in its country.

1.1.2

Where matches are broadcast, the camera specification set out below shall be mandatory as a minimum
requirement.

1.1.3

Where the camera specification set out above is provided, a third umpire shall be appointed to the match.

1.1.4

The provisions of paragraphs 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.1.3 above shall not apply for matches between a Full
Member country and Associate Member countries (whose matches have been granted T20I status) and for
matches between such Associate Member countries.

1.1.5

If the minimum requirements for DRS to be used are satisfied, both participating Boards may agree to
employ the DRS for a T20I match. Otherwise, the third umpire shall be appointed and empowered to use
broadcast replays to make decisions that are referred to him/her in accordance with paragraph 2 (Umpire
Reviews).

1.1.6

The table below summarises the minimum requirements for DRS to be used, and the regulations around the

The third umpire shall only have access to replays
of any camera images. Other technology which may
be in use by the broadcaster for broadcast purposes
(for example, ball-tracking technology, sound-based
edge detection technology, and heat-based edge
detection technology) shall not be used during
Umpire Reviews.

Any replay, stump microphone

paragraph 3.8.1 below.

ICC
Technical
Officer

Not required.

The ICC shall appoint an
independent technology expert
(ICC Technical Officer) to be
present at every series in which
the DRS is used to assist the
third umpire and to protect the
integrity of the DRS process.

The Home Board shall ensure that a separate room is provided for the third umpire and that he/she has
access to the television equipment and technology (where DRS is used) so as to be in the best position to
facilitate the referral and/or consultation processes referred to in paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3
(Player Review) below.

2 Umpire Review
In the circumstances detailed in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 below, the on-field umpire shall have the
discretion to refer the decision to the third umpire or, in the case of paragraphs 2.2, and 2.4, to consult with
the third umpire before making the decision. In line with clause 21.5, the third umpire shall already have
reviewed television replays of the bowler’s front foot landing and, where not satisfied that the second
requirement of clause 21.5.2 (front foot landing behind the popping crease)has not been met, shall
immediately have advised the bowler’s end umpire (who shall in turn have immediately called and signalled
No ball). Accordingly, paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3 (Player Review) of this Appendix D shall operate
on the basis that this element of the referral and/or consultation process has already been undertaken.
Save for requesting the umpire to review his/her decision under paragraph 3 (Player Review) below, players
may not appeal to the on-field umpires to use the Umpire Review. Breach of this provision may constitute
dissent and the player may be subject to disciplinary action under the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and
Player Support Personnel.
2.1

Run Out, Stumped, Bowled and Hit Wicket Decisions

2.1.1

The relevant on-field umpire shall be entitled to refer an appeal for run-out, stumped, bowled or hit wicket to
the third umpire.

2.1.2

An on-field umpire wishing to refer a decision to the third umpire shall signal to the third umpire by making
the shape of a TV screen with his/her hands.

2.1.3

In the case of a referral of a bowled, hit wicket or stumped decision, the third umpire shall first check the
fairness of the delivery (all modes of No ball except for (i) in respect of the front foot, which shall already
have been checked in accordance with clause 21.5; and (ii) the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action,
subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific
Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations). If the delivery was not a fair delivery the third

82

umpire shall indicate that the batter is Not out and advise the on-field umpire to signal No ball. See also
paragraph 2.6 below.
2.1.4

Additionally, if the third umpire finds the batter is Out by another mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not
out by any mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), he/she shall notify the on-field umpire so that the correct
decision is made.

2.1.5

If the third umpire decides that the batter is Out, a red light shall be displayed; if the third umpire decides that
the batter is Not out, a green light shall be displayed. Should the third umpire be temporarily unable to
respond, a white light (where available) shall remain illuminated throughout the period of interruption to
signify to the on-field umpires that Umpire Reviews are temporarily unavailable, in which case the decision
shall be taken by the on-field umpire. As an alternative to the red/green light system, the replay screen
(where available) may be used for the purpose of conveying the third umpire’s decision, in line with the ICC
Big Screen Policy.

2.2

Caught Decisions, Obstructing the Field

2.2.1

Where the bowler’s end umpire is unable to decide upon a Fair Catch or a Bump Ball, or if, on appeal from
the fielding side, the batter obstructed the field, he/she shall first consult with the striker’s end umpire.

2.2.2

Should both on-field umpires require assistance from the third umpire to make a decision, the bowler’s end
umpire shall firstly take a decision on-field after consulting with the striker’s end umpire, before consulting by
two-way radio with the third umpire. Such consultation shall be initiated by the bowler’s end umpire to the
third umpire by making the shape of a TV screen with his/her hands, followed by a Soft Signal of Out or Not
out made with the hands close to the chest at chest height. If the third umpire advises that the replay
evidence is inconclusive, the on-field decision communicated at the start of the consultation process shall
stand.

2.2.3

The third umpire shall determine whether the batter has been caught, whether the delivery was a Bump Ball,
or if the batter obstructed the field. However, in reviewing the television replay(s), the third umpire shall first
check the fairness of the delivery for all decisions involving a catch (all modes of No ball except for (i) in
respect of the front foot, which shall already have been checked in accordance with clause 21.5; and (ii) the
bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action, subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the
bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations) and
whether the batter has hit the ball. If the delivery was not a fair delivery or if it is clear to the third umpire that
the batter did not hit the ball he/she shall indicate to the bowler’s end umpire that the batter is Not out
caught, and in the case of an unfair delivery, advise the bowler’s end umpire to signal No ball. See also
paragraph 2.6 below. Additionally, if it is clear to the third umpire that the batter is Out by another mode of
dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), he/she shall notify the
bowler’s end umpire so that the correct decision can be made.

2.2.4

The third umpire shall communicate his/her decision as set out in paragraph 2.1.5.

2.3
2.3.1

Boundary Decisions
The bowler’s end umpire shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision on:

2.3.1.1

whether a four or six has been scored;

2.3.1.2

whether a fielder had any part of his/her person in contact with the ball when he/she touched the
boundary; or

2.3.1.3

whether the fielder had any part of his/her person in contact with the ball when he/she had any part of
his/her person grounded beyond the boundary.

2.3.1.4

the number of runs scored when a boundary results from an overthrow or the wilful act of a fielder (see
clause 19.8)

2.3.2

A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter.

83

2.3.3

If the television evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not a boundary has been scored, the default
presumption shall be in favour of no boundary being awarded.

2.3.4

Where the bowler’s end umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she
shall communicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her
decision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method.

2.3.5

The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows a
boundary line infringement or incident that appears not to have been acted upon by the on-field umpires.

2.4

Batters Running to the Same End

2.4.1

Where both batters have run to the same end and the on-field umpires are uncertain over which batter made
his/her ground first, the on-field umpires may consult with the third umpire.

2.4.2

The procedure set out in paragraph 2.3.4 shall apply.

2.5
2.5.1

2.6

Short run
The third umpire shall automatically review any call of Short run by an on-field umpire under clauses 18.3
and 18.4, communicating with the relevant on-field umpire by two-way radio and conveying his/her decision
by the same method.

No Balls

2.6.1

If the bowler’s end umpire is uncertain as to the fairness of the delivery following a dismissal (other than in
respect of the front foot, which shall have already been checked by the third umpire), either affecting the
validity of the dismissal or which batter is dismissed, other than in respect of clause 21.5 (Fair delivery – the
feet) for which the third umpire will already have checked, he/she shall be entitled to request the batter to
delay leaving the field and to check the fairness of the delivery with the third umpire. Communication with
the third umpire shall be by two-way radio.

2.6.2

The third umpire shall check all modes of No ball (other than in respect of the front foot, which shall have
already been checked) not already checked except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action (subject to
the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation
under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations).

2.6.3

If the delivery was not a fair delivery, the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the batter is Not out and
signal No ball (except in the case of a dismissal for obstructing the field, which may still be effected despite a
No ball being called, in which case the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the relevant batter is Out and
additionally call a No ball).

2.6.4

If a No ball under clause 21.5, after being reviewed by the third umpire, is only called by the bowler’s end
umpire after the ball is dead, the batting side shall benefit from the reversal of the dismissal and the one run
for the No ball but shall not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have accrued from the delivery had
the on-field umpire originally called a No ball prior to the ball becoming dead. Where the batters crossed
while the ball was in the air before being caught, the batters shall return to their original ends as if the striker
had been dismissed, but no runs shall be credited to the striker even if one (or more) runs were completed
prior to the catch being taken.

2.7

Cameras On or Over the Field of Play

2.7.1

The on-field umpires shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision as to whether the ball has at
any time during the normal course of play come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or its
cables above the playing area, as contemplated in clause 20.1.3.

2.7.2

Where an on-field umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she shall
communicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her
decision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method.

2.7.3

A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. If the television evidence is
inconclusive as to whether or not the ball has come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or

84

its cables above the playing area, the default presumption shall be in favour of no contact having been
made.
2.7.4

The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows the ball
to have been in contact with any part of the camera or its cables above the playing area as envisaged under
this paragraph.

3 Player Review
The following paragraphs shall operate in addition to and in conjunction with paragraph 2 (Umpire Review).

3.1

Circumstances in which a Player Review may be requested

3.1.1

A player may request a review of any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not a
batter is dismissed, with the exception of ‘Timed Out’ (Player Review).

3.1.2

No other decisions made by the umpires are eligible for a Player Review.

3.1.3

Only the batter involved in a dismissal may request a Player Review of an Out decision and only the captain
(or acting captain) of the fielding team may request a Player Review of a Not out decision.

3.1.4

A decision concerning whether or not a batter is dismissed that could have been the subject of a Umpire
Review under paragraph 2 is eligible for a Player Review as soon as it is clear that the on-field umpire has
chosen not to initiate the Umpire Review.

3.2

The manner of requesting the Player Review

3.2.1

The request shall be made by the player making a ‘T’ sign with both forearms at head height.

3.2.2

The total time elapsed between the ball becoming dead and the review request being made shall be no
more than 15 seconds.. The bowler’s end umpire shall provide the relevant player with a prompt after 10
seconds if the request has not been made at that time and the player shall request the review immediately
thereafter. If the on-field umpires believe that a request has not been made within the 15 second time limit,
they shall decline the request for a Player Review.

3.2.3

The captain may consult with the bowler and other fielders, and the two batters may consult with each other
prior to deciding whether to request a Player Review. Either the captain or the two batters may, in respect of
a decision relating to an appeal for LBW, question the bowler’s end umpire as to whether his/her decision
has been made on the basis that the striker made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat. Under no
other circumstances is any player permitted to query an umpire about any aspect of a decision before
deciding on whether or not to request a Player Review. If the on-field umpires believe that the captain or
either batter has received direct or indirect input emanating other than from the players on the field, then
they may at their discretion decline the request for a Player Review. In particular, signals from the dressing
room must not be given.

3.2.4

No replays, either at normal speed or slow motion, shall be shown on a big screen to spectators until the 15
second time limit allowed for requesting a Player Review has elapsed.

3.2.5

Where either on-field umpire initiates an Umpire Review, this does not preclude a player seeking a Player
Review of a separate incident from the same delivery. The request for a Player Review may be made after
the Umpire Review, provided the request is still within the 15 second time limit described in paragraph 3.2.2
above. (See paragraphs 3.9.2 and 3.9.3 below for the process for addressing both an Umpire and Player
Review).

3.2.6

A request for a Player Review cannot be withdrawn once it has been made.

3.3

The process of consultation

3.3.1

On receipt of an eligible and timely request for a Player Review, the relevant on-field umpire shall make the
sign of a shape of a TV screen with his/her hands in the normal way.

3.3.2

The relevant on-field umpire shall initiate communication with the third umpire by confirming;

85

3.3.2.1

That a Player Review has been requested,

3.3.2.2

The mode of dismissal for which the relevant on-field umpire adjudicated the appeal,

3.3.2.3

The decision that has been made (Out or Not out), and;

3.3.2.4

For LBW appeals, where relevant, if the bowler’s end umpire believed that the striker made no genuine
attempt to play the ball with the bat (the default presumption of the third umpire in the absence of any
information on this point from the bowler’s end umpire shall be that a genuine attempt to play the ball with
the bat was made).

3.3.3

A two-way consultation process shall begin to investigate whether there is anything that the third umpire can
see or hear which would indicate that the on-field umpire should change his/her original decision.

3.3.4

The third umpire shall not withhold any factual information which may help in the decision making process.
In particular, in reviewing a dismissal, if the third umpire believes that the batter may instead be Out by any
other mode of dismissal, he/she shall advise the on-field umpire accordingly. The process of consultation
described in this paragraph in respect of such other mode of dismissal shall then be conducted as if the
batter has been given Not out.

3.3.5

The third umpire shall initially check all modes of No ball except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling
Action (subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited
Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations), where appropriate advising the onfield umpire accordingly.

3.3.6

If despite the available technology, the third umpire is unable to decide with a high degree of confidence
whether the original on-field decision should be changed, then he/she shall report that the replays are
‘inconclusive’, and that the on-field decision shall stand. The third umpire shall not give answers conveying
likelihoods or probabilities.

3.3.7

In circumstances where the television technology (all or parts thereof) is not available to the third umpire or
fails for whatever reason, the third umpire shall advise the on-field umpire of this fact but still provide any
relevant factual information that may be ascertained from the available television replays and other
technology.

3.3.8

The on-field umpire shall then make his/her decision based on the information provided by the third umpire,
any other factual information offered by the third umpire and his/her recollection and opinion of the original
incident.

3.3.9

The on-field umpire shall reverse his/her decision if the nature of the supplementary information received
from the third umpire leads him/her to conclude that his/her original decision was incorrect.

3.4

Review of LBW Decisions

3.4.1

In assessing whether a batter is Out LBW in accordance with clause 36, the third umpire shall first judge
whether the delivery is fair (as set out in clause 36.1.1), and second, whether or not the ball has touched the
bat before being intercepted by any part of the striker’s person (as set out in clause 36.1.3).

3.4.2

If the batter is still eligible to be Out, the ball-tracking technology shall then present three pieces of
information to the third umpire relating to the path of the ball:

3.4.2.1

The point of pitching (where applicable) (PITCHING)

3.4.2.2

The position of the ball at the point of first interception (IMPACT)

3.4.2.3

Whether the ball would have hit the wicket (WICKET)

3.4.3

This Decision Review System (DRS) and Third Umpire Protocol includes a category of Umpire’s Call, which
shall be the conclusion reported where the technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the
point of first interception or whether the ball would have hit the stumps.

3.4.4

PITCHING

86

3.4.4.1

The interpretation of “pitches in line between wicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.2 shall refer to the position
of the centre of the ball at the point of pitching, in relation to the Pitching Zone.

3.4.4.2

The Pitching Zone is defined as a two dimensional area on the pitch between both sets of stumps with its
boundaries consisting of the base of both sets of stumps and a line between the outside of the outer
stumps at each end.

3.4.4.3

Where applicable, the ball-tracking technology shall report that the ball pitched in one of the following three
areas in relation to the Pitching Zone:

3.4.4.4

3.4.5

In Line

The centre of the ball was inside the Pitching Zone

Outside Off

The centre of the ball was outside, and to the off side of, the Pitching Zone

Outside Leg

The centre of the ball was outside, and to the leg side of, the Pitching Zone

Subject to the satisfaction of the other elements of clause 36.1, the batter can be Out if the ball-tracking
technology reports that the ball pitched Outside Off or In Line, but the batter shall be Not out if the ball
pitched Outside Leg.
IMPACT

3.4.5.1

The interpretation of “the (first) point of impact, even if in above the level of the bails, is between wicket
and wicket” in clause 36.1.4 shall refer to position of the ball at the point of first interception, in relation to
the Impact Zone.

3.4.5.2

The Impact Zone is defined as a three dimensional space extending between both wickets to an indefinite
height and with its boundaries consisting of a line between the outside of the outer stumps at each end.

3.4.5.3

The ball-tracking technology shall report that the point of first interception was in one of the following
categories in relation to the Impact Zone:
In Line

The centre of the ball was inside the Impact Zone

Umpire’s Call

Some part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, but the centre of the
ball was outside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-category of
‘Umpire’s Call (off side)’ where the centre of the ball was to the off side
of the Impact Zone and the bowler’s end umpire communicates to the
third umpire that no genuine attempt to play the ball was made by the
batter.

Outside

No part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, with the further subcategories of ‘Outside (off)’ and ‘Outside (leg)’ to indicate the location
of the point of first interception in relation to the Impact Zone when the
bowler’s end umpire communicates to the third umpire that no genuine
attempt to play the ball was made by the batter.

3.4.5.4

Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made a genuine attempt to
play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception was In Line for the
batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain Not out.

3.4.5.5

Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made no genuine attempt
to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of impact was In Line, or Umpire’s
Call (off side), or Outside (off) for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain
Not out.

3.4.5.6

Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made a genuine attempt to
play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception was Outside for the
decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible to be given Out.

87

3.4.5.7

3.4.6

Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made no genuine attempt to
play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception was Outside (leg)
for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible to be given Out.
WICKET

3.4.6.1

The interpretation of whether “the ball would have hit the wicket” in clause 36.1.5 shall refer to the position
of the ball as it either hits or passes the wicket, in relation to the Wicket Zone.

3.4.6.2

The Wicket Zone is defined as a two dimensional area whose boundaries are the outside of the outer
stumps, the base of the stumps and the top of the stumps.

3.4.6.3

The ball-tracking technology shall report whether the ball would have hit the wicket with reference to the
following three categories:

3.4.6.4

Hitting

The ball was hitting the wicket, and the centre of the ball was inside
the Wicket Zone

Umpire’s Call

The ball was hitting the wicket, but the centre of the ball was not
inside the Wicket Zone

Missing

The ball was missing the wicket

Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball was
Hitting for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain Not out.
However, where the evidence shows that the ball was Hitting, the point of first interception was
In Line, and the ball pitched In Line or Outside Off, but that:
•

The point of first interception was 300cm or more from the stumps; or

•
The point of first interception was more than 250cm but less than 300cm from the stumps
and the distance between the point of pitching and the point of first interception was less than
40cm,
the on-field decision shall stand (that is, Not out).
3.4.6.5

Where an Out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball was
Missing for the on-field decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible to be
given Out.

3.4.7

When the ball strikes the batter on the full, and the evidence provided by the ball-tracking technology
indicates that the ball would have pitched before striking or passing the wicket, there will be no information
available from that delivery that will allow the ball-tracking technology to accurately predict the height of the
ball after pitching.

3.4.8

With regard to determining whether the ball would have hit the wicket under these circumstances, the balltracking technology shall project the line of the ball in accordance with clause 36.2.3 (it is to be assumed
that the path of the ball before interception would have continued after interception, irrespective of whether
the ball might have pitched subsequently or not), and display the simulated path of the ball from directly
above the wicket.

3.4.9

The third umpire shall advise the bowler’s end umpire only on the point of first interception and whether the
ball would have hit the stumps (in line with the process set out in paragraph 3.4 above), but shall make no
comment on the predicted height of the ball after pitching, which shall remain a judgment of the bowler’s end
umpire.

3.5
3.5.1

The process for communicating the final decision
For Player Reviews concerning potential dismissals, the relevant on-field umpire shall indicate Out by raising
his/her finger above his/her head in a normal yet prominent manner or indicate Not out by the call of ‘not out’
and by crossing his/her hands in a horizontal position side to side in front and above his/her waist three

88

times. Where the decision is a reversal of the on-field umpire’s previous decision, he/she shall make the
‘revoke last signal’ indication immediately prior to the above.
3.5.2

3.6

If the mode of dismissal is not obvious or not the same as that on which the original decision was based,
then the umpire shall advise the scorers via the third umpire.

Number of Player Review requests permitted

3.6.1

In each innings, each team shall be allowed to make a maximum of two Player Review requests that is
categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ (as set out in paragraph 3.6.3 below).

3.6.2

Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision being reversed, then the Player
Review shall be categorised as ‘Successful’ and shall not count towards the innings limit.

3.6.3

Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision remaining unchanged (other
than in the circumstances set out in paragraphs 3.6.4, 3.6.6 or 3.6.8), the Player Review shall be
categorised as ’Unsuccessful’.

3.6.4

Where a request for a Player Review of an LBW decision results in the on-field decision remaining
unchanged solely on the basis of an Umpire’s Call, the Player Review shall be categorised as ‘Unchanged –
Umpire’s Call’. A Player Review categorised as ‘Unchanged – Umpire’s Call’ shall not count towards the
innings limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1.

3.6.5

Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Out is unchanged, but for a
different mode of dismissal from the original on-field decision, then the Player Review shall still be
categorised as ’Unsuccessful’.

3.6.6

Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Not out is unchanged on
account of the delivery being a No ball (for any reason), thereby not requiring any further evaluation, the
Player Review shall not be counted as ‘Unsuccessful’ and accordingly shall not count towards the innings
limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1.

3.6.7

Where a Player Review and an Umpire Review are requested from the same delivery and the decision of
the third umpire from the Umpire Review renders the Player Review unnecessary (see paragraphs 3.9.2 and
3.9.3), the Player Review request shall be disregarded and accordingly shall not count towards the innings
limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1.

3.6.8

A Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ may be reinstated by the ICC Match Referee at his/her sole
discretion (if appropriate after consultation with the ICC Technical Official and/or the television broadcast
director) if the Player Review could not properly be concluded due to a failure of the technology. Any such
decision shall be final and shall be taken as soon as possible, being communicated to both teams once all
the relevant facts have been ascertained by the ICC Match Referee. A Player Review categorised as
‘Unsuccessful’ shall not be reinstated if, despite any technical failures, the correct decision could still have
been made using the other available technology. Similarly, a Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’
shall not be reinstated where the technology worked as intended, but the evidence gleaned from its use was
inconclusive.

3.6.9

The third umpire shall be responsible for counting the number Player Reviews categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’
and shall advise the on-field umpires once either team has exhausted their allowance for the innings.

3.6.10

The scoreboard shall display, for the innings in progress, the number of Player Reviews remaining available
to each team.

Dead ball

3.7.1

If following a Player Review request, an original decision of Out is changed to Not out, then the ball is still
deemed to have become dead when the original decision was made (as per clause 20.1.1.3). The batting
side, while benefiting from the reversal of the dismissal, shall not benefit from any runs that may
subsequently have accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally made a Not out decision,
other than any No ball penalty that could arise under paragraph 3.3.5 above.

3.7.2

If an original decision of Not out is changed to Out, the ball shall retrospectively be deemed to have become
dead from the moment of the dismissal event. All subsequent events, including any runs scored, shall be
ignored.

3.8
3.8.1

Use of technology
The following technology may be used by the third umpire during a Player Review:

3.8.1.1

Replays, at any speed, from any available broadcast camera

3.8.1.2

Sound from the stump microphones with the replays at normal speed and slow motion

3.8.1.3

Approved ball-tracking technology:

3.8.1.4

3.8.1.5

•

HawkEye (HawkEye Innovations), or;

•

VirtualEye (ARL)

Approved sound-based edge detection technology:
•

Real-Time Snickometer (BBG Sports), or;

•

UltraEdge (HawkEye Innovations)

Approved heat-based edge detection technology:
•

3.8.1.6

Hot Spot cameras (BBG Sports)

LED Wickets (using the lights to indicate if the wicket is broken, as set out in paragraph 4.2):
•

Zing Bails and Stumps

3.8.2

In addition, other forms of technology may be used subject to the ICC being satisfied that the required
standards of accuracy and time efficiency can be met.

3.8.3

Where practical usage or further testing indicates that any of the above forms of technology cannot reliably
provide accurate and timely information, then it may be removed prior to or during a match. The final
decision regarding the technology to be used in a given match shall be taken by the ICC Match Referee in
consultation with the ICC Technical Official, ICC management and the competing teams’ governing bodies.

3.9

Combining Umpire Review with Player Review

3.9.1

If an Umpire Review (under paragraph 2) and a request for a Player Review (under paragraph 3) are made
following the same delivery but relating to separate modes of dismissal, the following process shall apply.

3.9.2

The Umpire Review shall be carried out prior to the Player Review if all of the following conditions apply:

90

3.9.2.1

The Player Review has been requested by the fielding side

3.9.2.2

The Umpire Review and the Player Review both relate to the dismissal of the same batter

3.9.2.3

If the batter is out, the number of runs scored from the delivery would be the same for both modes of
dismissal

3.9.2.4

If the batter is out, the batter on strike for the next delivery would be the same for both modes of dismissal.

3.9.3

If the Umpire Review leads the third umpire to make a decision of Out, then this shall be displayed in the
usual manner and the Player Review shall not be undertaken. If the Umpire Review results in a Not out
decision, then the third umpire shall make no public decision but shall proceed to address the request for a
Player Review.

3.9.4

For illustration, following an LBW appeal which is given Not out by the bowler’s end umpire, the striker sets
off for a run, is sent back and there is an appeal for his/her run out. The players request that the LBW
decision is reviewed and the umpires request that the run out be reviewed. The four criteria above are
satisfied, so the run out referral is determined first. Should the appeal for run out be Out, then there is no
requirement for the LBW review to take place.

3.9.5

In all other circumstances, the incidents shall be addressed in chronological order. If the conclusion from the
first incident is that a batter is dismissed, then the ball would be deemed to have become dead at that point,
rendering investigation of the second incident unnecessary.

4

Interpretation of Playing Conditions

4.1

When using a replay to determine the moment at which the wicket has been put down (as per clause 29.1),
the third umpire shall deem this to be the first frame in which one of the bails is shown (or can be deduced)
to have lost all contact with the top of the stumps and subsequent frames show the bail permanently
removed from the top of the stumps.

4.2

Where LED Wickets are used (as provided for in paragraph 3.8.1.6) the moment at which the wicket has
been put down (as per clause 29.1) shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are
illuminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps.

Appendix F
Super Over Procedure
The following procedure shall apply where the Playing Conditions provide for a Super Over to determine the winner of
a tied match. Other than where expressly stated in this Appendix (or by necessary implication), all relevant Playing
Conditions for the match shall apply to the Super Over.
1.

A Super Over involves each team facing an over of six balls (unless ended earlier as provided for in paragraph
2), and the winner shall be the team scoring the greater number of runs, irrespective of the number of wickets
lost.

2.

The loss of two wickets shall end the batting team’s one over innings.

3.

If the Super Over is a tie, subsequent Super Overs shall be played until a winner is determined. Other than in
exceptional circumstances (as set out in paragraph 25 below), an unlimited number of Super Overs may be
played where necessary to determine a result.

4.

Subject to weather conditions, the Super Over shall take place on the scheduled day of the match at a time to
be determined by the ICC Match Referee. In normal circumstances it shall commence 5 minutes after the
conclusion of the match.

5.

The Super Over shall be played until completion, but if there are any delays or interruptions during the Super
Over, extra time (taken from the start of the first Super Over) is allocated to complete the Super Over or any
subsequent Super Overs. The amount of extra time allocated to the Super Over is the greater of;
a)
the gap between the time at which the match ended and the time the original match would have been
scheduled to finish had the entire extra time provision been utilised, or
b)
20 minutes.

6.

Should play be delayed prior to or during the Super Over(s) once the playing time lost exceeds the extra time
allocated, the Super Over(s) shall be abandoned (see paragraph 24 below).

7.

The Super Over shall take place on the pitch allocated for the match, unless otherwise determined by the
umpires in consultation with the Ground Authority and the ICC Match Referee.

8.

Only nominated players in the match (including Concussion Replacements) may participate in the Super Over.

9.

Any penalty time being served in the match shall be carried forward to the Super Over.

10.

The umpires shall stand at the same end at which they finished the match.

11.

The team batting second in the match shall bat first in the Super Over.

12.

Each Team shall be allowed one unsuccessful player review per innings per Super Over. This entitlement
shall apply irrespective of the number of unsuccessful Player Review requests made during the match itself.

13.

The captain of the fielding team (or his/her nominee) shall select the ball with which the fielding team shall
bowl its over in the Super Over from the box of spare balls provided by the umpires (which shall include the
balls used in the match, but no new balls). The team fielding second may then choose to use the same ball
as chosen by the team bowling first or choose another ball from the same box. If the ball needs to be changed,
the relevant Playing Conditions as they apply in the match shall also apply in the Super Over.

14.

The fielding side shall choose the end from which it is to bowl its one over.

15.

The Super Over shall be played with the same fielding restrictions as would be applicable for the last over in
an uninterrupted match.

16.

The interval between the two overs in the Super Over shall be 5 minutes.

95

TIED SUPER OVER – REPEATING THE SUPER OVER
17.

If the Super Over is tied, then subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner (subject to
paragraph 26).

18.

In normal circumstances any subsequent Super Over shall start 5 minutes after the previous Super Over ends.

19.

The team batting second in the previous Super Over shall bat first in the subsequent Super Over.

20.

The balls selected for use by each team in the previous Super Over shall be used again by the same team in
any subsequent Super Over(s).

21.

The fielding side shall bowl its over in a subsequent Super Over from the opposite end from which it bowled
in the previous Super Over.

22.

Any batter dismissed in any previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bat in any subsequent Super Over.

23.

Any bowler who bowled in the previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bowl in the subsequent Super Over.

24.

In all other ways the procedure for a subsequent Super Over shall be the same as for the initial Super Over.

SUPER OVER UNABLE TO BE COMPLETED
25.

Where the Super Over or subsequent Super Overs are abandoned for any reason prior to completion then
the match shall be declared a tie and points allocated as in clause 16.11.1.

26.

In circumstances where there are unavoidable time constraints (for example, a requirement to switch off
floodlights at a certain time) which do not allow the completion of multiple Super Overs, the ICC Match Referee
may limit the number of possible Super Overs and shall advise both captains accordingly prior to the start of
the first Super Over.

EXAMPLES – EXTRA TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE SUPER OVER
Example 1: The match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, with 60 minutes of extra time available to be used. The
scheduled cut-off time if all the available extra time is used would be 11.20pm. The match runs over time and finishes
in a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available to
complete the Super Over would be 45 minutes (as per paragraph 5(a) above).
• The Super Over starts on time but is interrupted at 10.50pm for 10 minutes (leaving 35 minutes of extra time still
available).
• Play resumes at 11.00pm with a tied Super Over occurring.
• The second super over is being played but is interrupted at 11.15pm.
• Play does not resume within 35 minutes (being the amount of extra time still available), therefore the Super Over
procedure is abandoned, and the match is a tie.
Example 2: The same match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, but with 30 minutes of extra time available to be used.
The scheduled cut-off time if all the available extra time is used would be 10.50pm. The match runs over time and
finishes in a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available
to complete the Super Over would be 20 minutes (as per paragraph 5(b) above).

96

Appendix G
Application of the Reserve Day
If play is interrupted on the scheduled day, the umpires shall use the available extra time and, if necessary, reduce
the number of overs to try to achieve a result on that day.
In making their decisions in relation to ground, weather and light, the umpires shall aim to maximise play on the
scheduled day of the match in order to achieve a result on that day, as if there was no Reserve Day available.
Each team must have had the opportunity to bat for a minimum of five (5) overs for a result to be achieved (10 overs
in the semi-finals and final). If play has not resumed by the cut-off time required to allow the minimum number of
overs to be bowled to achieve a result on the scheduled day, play shall be abandoned for the day and the Reserve
Day shall be used to either complete the match or replay the match on the scheduled day.
If the Reserve Day is used to continue an incomplete match the Reserve Day shall be used as follows:
On the Reserve Day, play shall recommence under the same assumption that the last ball was bowled on the
scheduled day.
The match starts when the coin toss takes place and teams are exchanged. If the toss occurs on the scheduled day
and there is no play thereafter, the result of the toss and the named teams shall be carried through to the Reserve
Day.
The treatment of the pitch on the Reserve Day by the Ground Authority shall be as follows:
•

Covering and removal of covers – as for the scheduled day of the match under clause 10 of the Playing
Conditions; and

•

Mowing and rolling – as for Day 2 of a Test Match, under clause 9 of the ICC Test Match Playing Conditions.

Example 1: Match starts at 20 overs per side and there is an interruption at 9 overs. Overs are reduced to 17 overs
per side and play is about to resume. Before another ball is bowled it rains and play is abandoned for the day. As the
match did not resume under the revised overs, the match should continue on the Reserve Day at the original 20
overs per side with the overs reduced if necessary during the Reserve Day.
Example 2: The same start as in example 1 i.e. match starts at 20 overs per side and there is an interruption at 9
overs. Overs are reduced to 17 overs per side and play is about to resume. This time, play starts and after an over
has been bowled it rains and play is abandoned for the day. As the match has resumed, it is continued on the
Reserve Day at 17 overs per side with the overs further reduced if necessary during the Reserve Day.
